            <title><![CDATA[Sculpture at Ilana Goor Museum]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Sculpture at Ilana Goor Museum</h1>,<p>For the first time in Israel, you have the opportunity to admire works of art from the point of view of the artist/collector rather than as exhibits in a sterile academic environment.</p>,<p>The <a href="http://www.ilanagoor.com/eng/The-Building/The-Building/">Ilana Goor Museum </a>is located in an 18th century building surrounded by the breathtaking landscape of the shoreline of Tel Aviv and the <a href="http://www.ilanagoor.com/eng/Tours/Guided-Tours/">Old Jaffa City</a>. Fascinating historical events are ensconced within the Museum's walls dating back to 280 years ago, when the building served as the first Jewish Inn for pilgrims on their way to Jerusalem. The Museum was restored based on its original building and boasts over 500 Israeli, international and Ethnic Art alongside Ilana Goor's creations.</p>,<p>In the Museum there is a large and fascinating collection of sculptures of various sizes, forms and materials, which were sculpted in different time periods by Ilana Goor, international artists, veteran and young Israeli artists. Amongst them are sculptures by the English sculptor Henry Moore, the Italian sculptor Diego Giacometti and the Russian sculptor Archipenko (Sculpture Room) as well as Yaakov Agam’s kinetic sculptures (Main Atrium), Yaacov Dorchin’s monumental sculptures (Design Room) and works by Yigal Tomarkin (Main Atrium) together with authentic sculptures by Dr Yosef Sapir, Ilana Goor’s grandfather (Library) and ancient Christian sculptures made of olive wood (Christian Room). Through our website, you can get a sense of some of the unique sculptures displayed exclusively in the Museum, and of the various spaces in which each and every painting is exhibited</p>,<p><a href="http://www.ilanagoormuseum.org/eng/" title="">visit</a></p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/098a8bc8-d3be-458c-89d6-88ef109ddc9c.jpg" alt="Anna Goebel

            <title><![CDATA[paci contemporary gallery / porto cervo, italy]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>paci contemporary gallery / porto cervo, italy</h1>,<p><em><strong>Ensconced in the northern coastal jet-setting playground of Porto Cervo, Sardinia, famous for its jeweled-toned sea, sits another gem portside_not to be overlooked.</strong></em></p>,<p>While the buoyant glitterati ready yachts and great sailing vessels for adventures in paradise_ toasting to the magnificence surrounding the Bai of Sardinia, and the curious gather for celebrity sightings along the The Costa Smeralda, the Promenade du Port aka The Costa Smeralda Hub_ lies several meters inland from the mighty seafaring crafts. Designed as a “luxury space where people can gather day or night”, it is complete with international art galleries, high-end retailers, bars and fine dining establishments, and an array of events_ all with first class offerings.</p>,<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/49f07c81068668a20ece44566dda76f5810e2149.png">,<p>Paci Contemporary Gallery is among those glamorous offerings. Sitting pretty, shade side, the Paci Gallery sets its own course. Currently playing host to several photographic legends on both sides of the camera with an exhibition entitled “<em>Moda and Cinema”</em>, I was delighted to have the opportunity to view this collection of some of the most iconic women of the silver screen. The beauty was delivered_san aucun doute, not only detailing trends in fashion and makeup, but the posture, allure and enchantment of decades past, now preserved forever in archives, and brought back to life as the current vogue dictates. While the exhibition is well suited to it’s locale (Prince Aga Kahn’s creation) Paci’s presentation of the provocative and seductive is an engaging selection by the likes of such photographic luminaries as Douglas Kirkland, Bert Stern, William Klein, and Terry O’Neil, among others.</p>,<p>What is evident as you make your way around the gallery is how the photographers are aligned in the use of a “language”. To connect with their subject, the photographer must secure trust. The language is flirtation_ both visual and spoken, and very subtle, as it is the most important element in this photographic process. As an example, and most notably, Bert Stern has captured his star_ Marilyn, allowing the viewer to access the defining moment where intimacy is captured. And the result from Stern is clear in the outcome_ Monroe’s vulnerability. With vulnerability revealed, the intention is a success.</p>,<p>You can still catch the works, as they are on display until 30 September.</p>,<p>For additional information on upcoming exhibitions visit:<br><a href="mailto:info@pacicontemporarygallery.com">info@pacicontemporarygallery.com</a> / pacicontemporary.com<br>Promenade du Port_Via Aga Khan1 Porto Cervo, Italy</p>,<p>Image, courtesy of Paci Contemporary Gallery_Porto Cervo / 2017</p>]]></description>
