I am delighted to showcase a selection of interpretive works authored by an international network of artists&nbsp;and&nbsp;curated by a&nbsp;talented team,&nbsp;guided&nbsp;by artistic director Dr.Giuseppe Schembri-Bonaci and Nikki Petroni. It was a global triumph_ a narrative explored with diverse translations, creating a visual display in various mediums_ painting, sculpture, photography, and multimedia platforms_ artistic voices heard through the&nbsp;most personal of presentations.</p>,<p>In this 2nd&nbsp;edition, at the impressive the&nbsp;Mdina Cathedral Museum, over 30 works were presented throughout the&nbsp;treasury. The interplay of the works, installed on different landings, led&nbsp;the viewer on a spiritual traverse_ and to the cavernous underground passageway&nbsp;leveled below_ an&nbsp;ethereal space in itself.</p>,<p>With an invitation to participate, I delight in the&nbsp;bonds of friendship that were made through this&nbsp;distinctive and highly creative opportunity. Thus, I am proud to share this journey, and thank all the wonderful artists, academics, clergy and business entities, as well as visitors that have made this not only an exhibition,&nbsp;but a forum for its timely theme of conflicting spiritualities, an important&nbsp;one.</p>,<p><strong>The Artists_ The Works</strong></p>,<p><strong>Savina Capecci</strong>&nbsp;(in art Savina Kapecci)_ lives in Pordenone Italy, and studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Venice where she received&nbsp;her B.A. in Painting in 2014&nbsp;and her Master Degree in 2016 with full marks. She worked as assistant to the professors in the classes of painting at the Free Academy of Fine Arts in Klagenfurt, Austria as well as participating in selected exhibitions including:</p>,<ul><li>Premio Arte Cairo Mondadori Finalists exhibition, Palazzo Reale and Palazzo della Permanente, Milan</li><li>Transgenic Attack, Atelier der Stadt Klagenfurt, Austria solo exhibition</li><li>BV Sommerausstellung, BV Galerie, Klagenfurt, Austria</li><li>Memento Andy, Atelier 3+10, Venice</li><li>Fuori Uso, Avviso di garanzia, Ex Tribunal, Pescara</li><li>Premio Lilian Caraian, Museum of Modern Art Revoltella, Trieste</li><li>Incident III – Accident Czestochowa Museum, Poland</li></ul>,<p>Capecci&nbsp;has received several art awards with&nbsp;her work included in a variety of&nbsp;publications.</p>,<p>The works presented at the Mdina Biennale are titled “The PromiSSed land”. The painted images depict the human aspect of the current immigration crisis happening in the Mediterranean sea, and are expressive of the essence of the concept of “waiting” in all its forms and feelings that arise&nbsp;while sitting in a boat. The Promised land inevitably becomes a “pro-missed” land.</p>,<p><a href="http://www.savinakapecci.com/">www.savinakapecci.com</a>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<a href="http://savina_capecci@libero.it/savinakapecci@gmail.com">savina_capecci@libero.it</a>&nbsp; /&nbsp;<a href="http://savina_capecci@libero.it/savinakapecci@gmail.com">savinakapecci@gmail.co</a>m</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6eec7083-3d2d-4804-9412-79847f6754e8.jpg">,<p>Courtesy of the artist_&nbsp;<strong>The PromiSSed land</strong></p>,<p>+</p>,<p><strong>James Alec Hardy_&nbsp;</strong>born –&nbsp;1979 in&nbsp;Colchester, England.&nbsp;The essence of James Alec Hardy’s practice is a process concerned with the impact of technologies on our experience of life.&nbsp;Since 2002, he has focused on analogue video systems, manifesting ideas through performance, sculpture, installation and print. By using&nbsp;obsolete devices from a former analogue age to reproduce digital functions, Hardy’s practice is challenging and engaging_ranging from&nbsp;building sculptural totems of video monitors, to 3 month long shamanic residencies in fields with I-Cabin, to 3 day long noise and feedback&nbsp;performances at The Tate Modern.</p>,<p>“With the truth being understood as subjective, the video sculptures I create do not limit freedom of thought, but stimulate choice. I aim to&nbsp;avoid manipulating the viewer by presenting ‘video as truth’, my work allows the video to function ultimately as the meditative stage for the&nbsp;mind, which unravels its own truth.”<strong></strong></p>,<p>1999-2002: Camberwell College of Arts, London<br>Present: Warrior Studios, London &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Represented by Kristin Hjellegjerde Gallery London</p>,<p>instagram @jamesalechardy /&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sitbackandrelapse.com/">www.sitbackandrelapse.com</a></p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c44906c9-5b83-4891-8986-69dd21bbaca9.jpg">,<p>Courtesy of the artist_<strong>“171111”</strong></p>,<p>+</p>,<p><strong>Robert Stokowy_&nbsp;</strong>is a sound artist, composer and artistic researcher from Cologne, Germany. His work entails experimental compositions, text based interventions, audiovisual performances and installations. All projects are framed by an overarching artistic research process, focussing on topics of instability, sensory balance, as well as qualitative characteristics and potentiality of sound and place. Stokowy’s&nbsp;site-specific Sound Installations are based on phenomenological practices and consist of small sounds which hold very haptic and organic qualities. With his works the artist wants to explore the potentiality of his sonic surroundings and give recipients access to experience new perspectives on their environment.</p>,<p>Since Stokowy’s&nbsp;work is first and foremost based on sound, a recording&nbsp;of the&nbsp;installation is available on his&nbsp;website.</p>,<p>Instagram:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/robertstokowy/">robertstokowy</a>&nbsp;/ www.robert-stokowy.de</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d9046899-eeb7-4fdd-a7b2-5b0ea6bd84c1.jpg">,<p>Courtesy of the artist_&nbsp;<strong>structures [mdina]&nbsp;</strong><em></em></p>,<p>+</p>,<p><strong>Anthony Catania_</strong>&nbsp;is a visual artist specializing in myths and fables. Often on the threshold of grotesque figurative painting, his style attempts to capture subversively idiosyncratic portraits of legendary beings embedded in bizarrely anachronistic settings. His personal exhibitions;&nbsp;<em>Selve Oscure</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Cave of Centaurs</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Piper’s Requiem</em>,&nbsp;<em>Spectre-Bark</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Last Light</em>, were held at the Malta Museum of Fine Arts, the Malta Maritime Museum and Heritage Malta. Catania is a PhD candidate at the University of Malta, where he also received his MFA in Digital Arts with a distinction. Catania also worked as a concept designer for indie games<em>,&nbsp;</em>poster designer for theatre productions and illustrator of academic book covers. He currently lectures on illustration, primitivism and sequential art at the University of Malta.</p>,<p><em>Wilting Annunciation</em>&nbsp;depicts the typical scene where the angel Gabriel announces the birth of Christ and incarnation of God. The announcement is that of Christ’s passion endured for humanity’s redemption from the agony in the garden of Gethsemane until His death on Calvary. It also depicts the passion of a Mater Dolorosa who will cradle the corpse of her son through fertile/dead sunflower seeds.&nbsp;Death and life are depicted in an oxymoronic manner.</p>,<p>www.anthonycatania.com</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3729e946-5f23-4a31-8d71-b3a08cb76f74.jpg">,<p>Courtesy of the artist_&nbsp;<strong>Wilting Annunciation</strong></p>,<p>+</p>,<p><strong>Gor Chahal_&nbsp;</strong>was born in Moscow in&nbsp;1961 and is one of the most highly accomplished contemporary artists. His creative method synthesizes a scholastic approach with the elements of a ritual. Chahal is of a type rarely found in the Russian artistic community: a «universal master», with a diploma in science and applied mathematics, from the Moscow Engineering and Physics Institute, a contributor to numerous creative experiments undertaken in cooperation with groups of poets, musicians, and artists of Soviet-era Underground. But while the style of Chahal’s creations lie within the parameters of Actual Art, yet in substance they are at the other end of the spectrum. His themes often encompass faith and show a deep awareness that true art simply cannot exist without connection to tradition of the sacred, Christianity in this case.</p>,<p>mail@chahal.ru</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2db1a211-836f-4df9-92ae-0d9b8fb23bd6.jpg">,<p>Courtesy of the artist_<strong>St. George strikes Cy Twombly, 2017</strong></p>,<p>+</p>,<p><strong>Michael von Cube_&nbsp;</strong>Born&nbsp;– 1952, Cube lives and works in Munich, Lower-Bavaria and Malta.</p>,<p>The reality of the political situation in the Mediterranean surpasses the image of brutality by far, and&nbsp;so the picture remains what it should be and is – a helpless plea: art.</p>,<p>When Johann Wolfgang von Goethe set off on his travels to Italy, the Age of Enlightenment was of&nbsp;great significance in Europe. The education system and lifestyle of the ancient world was seen as&nbsp;the model for a civil society. Committed to ‚Goodness, Truth and Beauty‘ (Winckelmann), artists&nbsp;and romantics from all walks of like were drawn to the cradle of European culture: The&nbsp;Mediterranean.&nbsp;The painter Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein created the famous portrait of the German writer&nbsp;entitled „Goethe in the Roman Campagna“.</p>,<p>‘Europium‘ takes an ironic look at this idealistic approach or what is indeed left of it today:&nbsp;The princess of peace and her system of values surrounded by lemons symbolising a united Europe.&nbsp;It refers to the vision of the writer, Goethe, just like peace-game‘ does to the abolition of violence&nbsp;and war.</p>,<p>www.michael-von-cube.de</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b58a36d7-d793-4b49-af8f-90168fd46e9e.jpg">,<p>Courtesy of the artist_<strong>Europium</strong></p>,<p>+</p>,<p><strong>Guy Ferrer_&nbsp;</strong>is French, of Catalan and Italian descent. Over the past thirty years he has developed an international reputation as a painter and sculptor, with exhibitions in museums and galleries around the world. In addition to painting and sculpture his work also encompasses writing and architecture.&nbsp;Ferrer has worked in Paris, Los Angeles and other international cities, including New York, Caracas, Lima, Beijing and Johannesburg where he has created temporary studios. In 2012, the establishment of his studio in French Catalonia marked his return to the Mediterranean.</p>,<p>Recent honours include a monumental bronze sculpture for the French embassy in Singapore and a large fresco for the French embassy in Bakou (Azerbaijan).

She is also interested on the impact their existence&nbsp;have in our society, in particular architecture, politics and gender roles. Steel is Pereira’s material&nbsp;of choice – its chemical properties and reactions determine the subject of the work. She&nbsp;combines&nbsp;this metal with other materials in order to activate or counteract their intrinsic properties.</p>,<p>Pereira completed her Masters at Chelsea College of Arts in 2012, being awarded with Clifford&nbsp;Chance Prize the following year. In 2014, Pereira received the Royal British Society of Sculptors&nbsp;Bursary. The work shown at Mdina Biennal in 2015 represents the beginning of a new body of work&nbsp;that explored the rigidity that characterises steel.</p>,<p>Pereira’s work was selected for several listings and shown in a variety of occasions, including the&nbsp;Aesthetic Art Prize (2014), Signature Art Prize (2015), Anthology (2016) and First@108 (2017).&nbsp;This last experience opened her the desire to work outdoors, which was realised with “Now outside&nbsp;the doors of strange houses”.

It does so for minutes, for hours, for days. There’s no aim in sight, not even a fata morgana. Synchronously a timepiece slowly but surely is wandering across the scene.&nbsp;While at first glance the character seems to be driven by customary stress and inner conflicts, it turns out that the piece is tackling the more sensitive issues of modern societies.&nbsp;If the attire of the character is any indication, it’s about civilization at large, which in the eyes of many people is at stake these days.&nbsp;Maybe the artist wants to remind us of two facts: 1. People on this planet have been running along the surface of the earth’s crust in search for paradise for ages. 2. It’s the Mediterranean, which once again is the arena of the world’s greatest conflicts.</p>,<p><a href="http://www.lapschina.com/">www.LAPSCHINA.com</a></p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d2d1243d-5de5-4af8-8d1e-8f05ef3fd653.jpg">,<p>Courtesy of the artist_&nbsp;<strong>Runtime</strong>&nbsp;/&nbsp;site-specific three-channel video installation with sound; dimensions variable.&nbsp;2017</p>,<p>+</p>,<p><strong>Aleko Lomadze_&nbsp;</strong>is a&nbsp;Georgian artist whose work is iconographic in nature.

            <title><![CDATA[Nudes in the Forest]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Nudes in the Forest</h1>,<p>Elijah Burgher vernisaj at Ivan Gallery in Bucharest</p>,<p>By Eugen Berlo</p>,<p>I had the pleasure of meeting and discussing with Elijah at his first show in Bucharest at <a href="http://www.ivangallery.com/en/exhibition/47/nudes-in-the-forest" title="">IvanGallery</a> the other day. Born in 1978, Kingston, NY, USA, he is an American artist in residency at <a href="http://hortongallery.com/residency/" title="">Horton Gallery studio</a> in Berlin, Germany.  Burgher works with the language of mag­ic and the mystical seals and symbols to address sex­u­al­i­ty, the nude subject and its capacity to convey meaning. Most of his presented artworks are luscious prints on paper realized with handmade heavyweight paper stencils and printmaking techniques. </p>,<p><em>“Titles are important, they’re like breadcrumb trails. The nude is an age-old subject of art. Most crucially for me, the nude has frequently served as a vehicle for expressing love, desire, and beauty, as well as erotic frenzy, terror and pain. The sigils represent desire too, and, like an aroused or arousing nude, they appear in the red alphabet blushing, hot and bothered, full-frontal or spread-eagle, totally naked. I am hoping that the title will be reminiscent of the well-known Baudelaire poem, “Correspondences”, which features the phrase, “forêts de symboles,” usually translated into english as “symbol forest” or “forest of symbols,” but also “cabalistic wood.” I enjoy contemplating being lost in a forest of symbols, of going for a walk in Grunewald, for instance, and seeing the tree branches spell out strange signs, or, alternatively, experiencing Kottbusser Tor, so full of blinking signage, as a wilderness, a place in which to lose oneself. Chants, of course, are simple, repetitive songs or intonations used in ritual. I enjoy the implication that the Chants are the voices of the Nudes, or that there are chanting voices in the forest.“ (Elijah Burgher)</em></p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9fa66920-1c46-49f0-84db-fa68080cc264.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/333d3f12-e153-457c-9cb6-cce3e0f9262c.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4f1b7358-33ee-4ce7-9b69-46d5049252cc.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4bfef27e-30f5-4c4a-b49a-801588df8dae.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8bc3e47c-0ab2-4acb-b031-49a1b6d6ca75.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f2dc41b1-c0e0-4443-a995-2ac93cb58b83.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c2c2ecf8-a355-4379-8b80-f0f6a458d5a8.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/71bedb07-8788-4c2b-8420-53754edcfb6e.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/210f3361-ac1f-4090-a2dc-da93d29f0ce4.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c188476b-24a0-440c-b294-cf44e5383daa.jpg">]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>'SEEING OURSELVES SENSING' by Eastwards Prospectus</h1>,<p>by Eugen Berlo 2017-07-15</p>,<p>Tomorrow is the last day, but it’s worth to make an appointment and pay a visit to the gallery. The group show is also a statement by Raluca Soaita and Andrei Breahna. As I like to follow up with a few galleries, I have (Yahveh) to say go and see it!; it is a good one and it will please you to see a nice range of artists, from Razvan Anton, Pavel Braila, Radu Cioca, to Tania Mouraud, Karolina Bregula and Mircea Stanescu. Many thanks to Răzvan Băbiceanu who walked me through.</p>,<p>“This public showing is the way Raluca Soaita and Andrei Breahna responsibly position themselves as related to the artists hosted by their gallery. The constant presence of video in the public space, the American-school photo, the drawing, the installation, the performance, the animation – they all have shaped a certain artist / intellectual profile in the gallery space, one bearing various practices, which EASTWARDS PROSPECTUS is supporting and developing. The exhibition is a coherent and clear discourse about the gallerist/artist relationship, about the exhibition space and the challenges raised by certain works that one feels connected to.” - <a href="https://www.eastwardsprospectus.com/seeing-ourselves-sensing/" title="">read more</a></p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3510b18d-1e6a-48ec-8f4c-12f2ee6a07cb.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e6aeb1dc-063d-4eb7-a234-b305279ddce3.jpg">,<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/aeba9f7c122a122ec25a472d791f6df13cd796c2.jpg">,<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9f1ba5716af1f75bbf2ae5a6f03e81bc8edf0a7c.jpg">,<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fc4a1fc35947c2e2156c983e016e9688f926eefb.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/acb7798c-88e6-4868-92eb-db6122dc9b4b.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f6994efd-b6c7-4183-83e3-07bbe2feb42a.jpg">,<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/bf16a9ef308175a715d956ce43cbabd9017c6a54.jpg">,<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/393b6492d15c9a9d4340d256f2ce5331c28fce66.jpg">,<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f655a44479baaacc58b018858346076e41989cc1.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/5caa1632-a961-4514-86ca-f4645a4074a2.jpg">,<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/974d1fd1702e89d17a9c42cc7f7726afdfa11109.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e61fc732-5a40-48c6-8508-59d7936a150f.jpg">,<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/7d5d821221041d2104a4f863120a7680147f11d5.jpg">]]></description>

The gallery is reminiscent of the old communist era, and the show is in plain sight, as one can watch through the windows of the gallery, and even though you have to enter strangely to the back door, once you are inside you get to warm up in the presence of the artworks. You start to recognize the spirit of subtle latin humor in Marian’s approach to his creation of E-Vapotarus, meaning repurposing of sensually tactile vintage objects and cleverly giving them a new life as intricate part of the new objects on display. On the other side against the wall you find yourself immersed into a grave deep lyric emotion of the “Wheels and Chakras” To me they are the definition of solid yet delicate, rustic yet pleasant, technically improbable yet archetypal.</p>,<p>by Genu Berlo</p>,<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/872a343723797adac76b56ac7a1d7d45160da100.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/49ce6da8-7e68-4cfe-8f50-fe251a976d5a.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/677d2401-7dfe-41a8-8993-8d2d25f42b91.jpg">,<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ec8e96156d7fd17ffc65fe3fea6abb106488fca7.jpg">,<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4f2ac74950ce27215700f050dc2db6ce4baaacb0.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1be7078b-f292-4351-bbf1-b247818f3d4d.jpg">,<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/de0b50a6f82257ed59a5c2106499325c140d67b1.jpg">,<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f4ddbb8dca3220790d7426fde0c9bfde74a4d6eb.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/aba9ae89-3993-4013-ab71-75ac57a20587.jpg">,<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/41d838483f33d24aae200d7e066806fd9431f48d.jpg">,<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/823d7c4e1ed6874a5e114b40322fece028f435f9.jpg">,<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4ab7f62dade822086653dffbd2c691054342d7b0.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2ef35d5a-ad26-4fa4-8b81-595de3f29992.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a8752fa1-6776-4bde-982e-991fcbb84b12.jpg">,<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6fcf677d972001b742c174eb4a291a013715b5dd.jpg">,<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e206e4a7a59cd662718bcf1e9858101a58262a2e.jpg">,<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/291d82b05c6c1e6126584cd5642e31b85c1a5c9b.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/16e003f6-5fda-418b-99fe-9cc6a3fda66e.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/889192ea-ddd7-45d4-80bb-143f3668eb9f.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/afb9f49d-ce42-4949-8a05-52e187a86684.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7ec1b9d4-3d07-45dc-ab2c-72c0196c05c8.jpg">]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>THE CHERKASHIN’S. NEW DRAWINGS. A NEW CHAPTER.</h1>,<p>Renay Elle Morris / June 2017</p>,<p><strong>For decades, Valera and Natasha Cherkashin</strong> have added layer upon layer of philosophical and political ideology to their masterful works of photographic genius. With exhibitions, lectures and talks on an international stage, the art of their images have recently been compiled into a 254 page publication entitled, <strong>Actions, Happenings and art performances 1962 – 2016 _ Night with a Pioneer Leader</strong>, which delves into a history of 2 artists_a husband and wife team, and the legacy of their talent. What inspires them may not offer an easy answer. Perhaps it is a fearless energy to defend beliefs, or a lifetime of a Soviet regime. Perhaps it was Perestroika, the political movement and the "openness"policy that led to the reforms of the Soviet political and economic system during the1980s that allowed for such ambitious work.</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3df39e8c-e4a5-44a7-bc81-6191dc9c8271.jpg" title="&quot;Untitled 1&quot;">]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>_lee friedlander at work / a slice of americana in bologna</h1>,<p>/ Fondazione Del Monte – Palazzo Paltroni / Bologna Italy  </p>,<p>by Renay Elle Morris / January 2018</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4bde87b9-d7e4-49b2-bd6b-c95b560650cc.png">,<p>Looking back on 2017, I was fortunate to engage in several photographic presentations that offered specific themes, albeit quite different. In particular, with an invitation to participate in the prestigious 2017-18 Mdina Cathedral Art Biennale in Malta’s <em>The Mediterranean: A Sea of Conflicting Spiritualities</em>, as an exhibiting photographer and the only American to receive this honor, I navigated with both intention, and agenda working in tandem to add Bologna Italy to my itinerary. I boarded planes, trains, buses and such for the 3rd edition of Foto/Industria in association with MAST Fondazione’s BIENNIAL OF PHOTOGRAPHY ON INDUSTRY AND WORK. It was for me, a tasting _a mixture of art and cuisine, as Bologna is Italy’s capital of food. And, I wasn’t disappointed on both counts.</p>,<p>The Biennial (12 October-19 November) highlighted the work of 14 extraordinary image-makers at exhibitions located in galleries throughout a city shrouded by architecture of medieval beginnings. My arrival on 17 November afforded me an opportunity for a quick viewing. Having this very short window, I decided to limit my coverage to the images of Lee Friedlander. The Palazzo Paltroni, was the designated space to host his presentation of <em>At Work</em>.</p>,<p>For introductory purposes, one learns Friedlander is considered one of the foremost photographers of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. American born (Aberdeen Washington (1934), his images detail America’s social landscape. They have been noted as “keen depictions” that include the worlds of jazz, television, urban landscapes and deserts. <em>At Work</em>, is a monograph dedicated to the urban life of largely the anonymous worker photographed over a 16 year period beginning in 1979. It is a commissioned work offering a cultural fabric woven with images of factories and offices, as well as tools, work practices, and relationships in professional settings. Shot in black and white with the use of a 35mm Leica, the work defined an era. “Friedlander has acknowledged the largely anonymous worker, making inventive pictures of the familiar, humdrum, yet overriding role of work in America.” Throughout the course of this assignment, Friedlander maintained his personal artistic freedom and integrity. True to his aesthetic, it is an outstanding selection of photographs that give homage to a place and time_ a brilliant documentation and archive of Middle America and its working class and social structure.</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/119bdf9f-518c-4ce8-8568-2deda43796ae.png">,<p><em><strong>“Friedlander has acknowledged the largely anonymous worker, making inventive pictures of the familiar, humdrum, yet overriding role of work in America.”</strong></em>_ Fraenkel Gallery</p>,<p>What was of great fascination was the play between the view and the viewer. I buried myself between young students engaged in dialogue with professors, individuals from foreign lands, like me _ just enough to catch a few remarks in English and Italian. At various moments, noting the crowds, I thought of how different this all must seem _a retrospective of working class Americans in past decades, in black and white, before digital, before selfies. It was profound.</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8372215e-408f-45fa-b77a-b6507ce0867f.png">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/5e5d513a-e970-475c-8de0-29ecb579ff6a.png">,<p>As a student, I was fortunate to have the experience to work only in black and white, capturing images with the use of 4×5, 2¼ and 35mm cameras_ bracketing exposures. And not to forget, spending countless hours in darkrooms, adjusting enlargers, and submerging hands in developers and fixers. Now, when I stare at Friedlander’s work, I am reminded of how artfully we were trained. How precise we were with every shot. Kudos for MAST and Foto/Industria for its presentation of <em>At Work</em> which ultimately reminds us of this lost art.</p>,<p>Lee Friedlander is represented by Fraenkel Gallery – ­San Francisco, CA.

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Reduction Woodblock Print</h1>,<p>For a reduction woodblock print the designs for each color are carved onto the same block. The artist starts by carving the design of the lightest color on a wooden block. Then all paper impressions are pulled in the desired number of the edition planned. The second layer for the second color is carved and the impressions are pulled. And so on - until the desired image is complete.</p>,<p>At the end the original block has destroyed itself by the process. The printing of more copies than originally planned is impossible.</p>,<p>The technique of a reduction woodblock print requires careful planning of the whole process by the artist and excellent craftsmanship in carving and printing. Due to the complexity the number of colors are limited for a reduction woodblock print.</p>,<p>The artist seldom uses more than 5 different colors. For more intricate color designs, artists may use more than one block. As long as more than one color are pulled from one block and as long as the process cannot be repeated due to the natural destruction of the block, one can regard it as a reduction woodblock print.</p>,<p><a href="https://www.artelino.com/articles/chinese-reduction-woodblock-prints.asp" title="">artelino</a></p>,<h3>Reflections in a Blue Lake: The Woodblock Prints of Chen Li</h3>,<p>A selection of reduction woodblock prints by Chen Li.</p>,<p>KATRINE LEVIN GALLERIES Feb 19th – 24th London</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6b17914a-dc81-4265-954d-09e2ec5649f6.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a4c276cf-d936-4137-8952-019be7517f68.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bab93683-ffdf-4f11-a25a-83d72a0d0d77.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1e50a0de-e7ae-4987-8551-9a4de03dbd74.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1d30143b-63d6-4388-bfc2-07150d109443.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b63526e7-ebc3-4fca-9cb1-fda59a117790.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2718520f-8e98-4ca9-9354-2555ad577438.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/95ea3f04-e588-480e-a8e6-ced4977ee48a.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e6453ed9-3f5d-4bb9-bfd1-4c2cafab534b.jpg">]]></description>
