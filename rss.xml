AIPAD 2018</a></h1>,<p>BY RENAY MORRIS</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a0fd3536-328c-44fa-bd88-5d3bfdaa5a7d.png">,<p><strong>©&nbsp;Nobuyoshi Araki&nbsp;</strong><em><strong>“</strong></em><strong>Dead Reality</strong><em><strong>”</strong></em><strong></strong>&amp; Courtesy<strong>&nbsp;Little Big Man Gallery</strong>, Los Angeles</p>,<p>Although the weather outside was troubling, inside_&nbsp;The Pier at 94th in New York City lit up any dreary notions with its presentation of &nbsp;THE PHOTOGRAPHY SHOW PRESENTED BY AIPAD. (05-08 April 2018.) For the 2nd&nbsp;year at its new home, dockside&nbsp;the Hudson River, the 38th edition of the highly selective photographic expo once again proved to be a&nbsp;mecca for a worldwide audience&nbsp;of photo enthusiasts.&nbsp;AIPAD (Association of International Photography Art Dealers) presented a brilliant range of museum-quality work, including the genres of contemporary, modern, and 19th-century photographs, as well as photo-based art, video, and new media. The venue was complete with 96 of the world’s leading fine art photography galleries, over 30 book sellers, 15 AIPAD talks, three special exhibitions as well as host of engaging events. It is the longest-running and foremost exhibition dedicated to the photographic medium.</p>,<p>I would be remiss if I did not give an overview/highlights,&nbsp;as those not familiar will note that compliment to the&nbsp;rows of gallery spaces,&nbsp;a myriad of events spanned the fete, catching the eyes of curators, photo pros&nbsp;and&nbsp;amateurs alike, as well as a bevy of photo enthusiasts who find the art of the medium irresistible. It was an opportunity&nbsp;to participate in an appetizing array of forums/lectures curated by a coveted team of experts.</p>,<p>While&nbsp;visitors circulated_&nbsp;making&nbsp;the rounds&nbsp;in an easy flow and&nbsp;welcomed by the suitably&nbsp;arranged lounge areas affording snacks,drinks and conversation,&nbsp;AIPAD&nbsp;introduced&nbsp;twelve new galleries_ 6×7 Gallery Warsaw; galerie SIT DOWN, Paris; In The Gallery, Copenhagen; Jean-Kenta Gauthier, Paris; MEM, Tokyo; Paul Nicklen Gallery, New York; Sears-Peyton Gallery, New York; Senior &amp; Shopmaker Gallery, New York; The Ansel Adams Gallery, Yosemite National Park, CA; Three Shadows +3 Gallery, Beijing; Todd Webb Archive, Portland, ME; and Toluca Fine Art, Paris.</p>,<p>Among the planned activities were Solo Exhibitions/Themed Exhibitions, Performance/Politics, Visual commentaries on Social Issues and Resistance, as well Rare and Abstract Works.&nbsp;Three Special Exhibitions_</p>,<p>&gt;A Time for Reflection, curated by Sir Elton John, with work selected from AIPAD member galleries and available for purchase, with&nbsp;a portion of sales to&nbsp;benefit The Sir Elton John Charitable Trust.</p>,<p>&gt;Forever Young: Selections from the Joe Baio Collection of Photography, on childhood and adolescence, was on exhibit publicly for the first time.</p>,<p>&gt;All Power: Visual Legacies of the Black Panther Party, curated by Michelle Dunn Marsh, Executive Director and Curator at the Photographic Center Northwest, showcases contemporary black artists who have been informed or influenced by the Black Panther movement.</p>,<p>And to note:</p>,<p>&gt;The Staley-Wise Gallery of New York, featured famous rockers, including a 1974 photograph of John Lennon and Mick Jagger, a 1964 photograph of the Beatles reading their fan mail, and from that same year a portrait of Bob Dylan and Joan Baez with a sign that says, “Protest Against the Rising Tide of Conformity.”</p>,<p>&gt;A solo exhibition at the Etherton Gallery, Tucson, was W. Eugene Smith at 100. This work is from the archive of Takeshi Ishikawa, who was Smith’s assistant for three years during the photographer’s time in Minamata, Japan. Some of the images of Smith at work in Minamata have never been shown outside Japan.</p>,<p>&gt;I was struck by JHB Gallery’s amazing image “Crush &amp; Pull” which I would learn was created by artist&nbsp;Ellen Carey. Her&nbsp;masterful use&nbsp;of the photographic medium combines Polaroid negatives and photograms_ a photographic print made by laying objects onto photographic paper and exposing it to light.</p>,<img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/2b2431f8e7ba7b0/5f5bd8e5ccb2e2e8ca7f12e7d8d30606/croprotate.png?cropheight=1489&cropwidth=1579&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fdc12df0c-fa2d-4710-87d8-d28172f8e7ca.png&x=319&y=0">,<p><strong>© Ellen Carey, “Crush &amp; Pull”, 2018</strong>&amp; Courtesy<strong>JHB Gallery</strong>, New York</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/797321d7-127c-41f4-9339-62875a87859f.png">,<p><strong>© Renay Elle Morris</strong>_ renayellemorris.com </p>,<p>Portrait Studies was crowdpleaser_including those by Sally Mann, Ethiopian artist Aida Muluneh, as well as two_ of Winston Churchill and of Ernest Hemingway&nbsp;by&nbsp;Yousuf Karsh.

            <title><![CDATA[Andrei Cădere ]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Andrei Cădere </h1>,<p><strong>André Cadere</strong> was born in Poland, grew up in Romania and died in Paris in 1978. He was best known for his handmade series of painted round wooden bars, challenging the boundaries between painting and sculpture. Cadere was one of the first artists to realize that objects were inseparable from market and institutional contexts: half of his focus was on the systems of distribution in the art world, as he introduced bars in galleries and retract them, usually carrying a bar like a staff. His bars could be positioned in all sorts of relations to their surroundings (on walls, floors, propped between the two, etc.), but he would also carry them around a number of outdoor locations and into other people’s shows and openings, even when not invited, which made him quite ”infamous” at the time. (He was nicknamed ”The Stick Man”.)</p>,<p><strong>Andrei Cădere </strong>(1934-1978) este unul dintre cei mai importanţi reprezentanţi ai artei conceptuale mondiale. Ca fiu al unui proeminent diplomat român, Andrei Cădere a suferit în primele decenii comuniste o existență marginală, sub supravegherea Securității. A emigrat în Franța în 1967 și, după mai mulți ani de căutări, a devenit o figură memorabilă a scenei culturale pariziene și nu numai. Mereu însoțit de faimoasele lui toiege sculptate și pictate, descinzând inopinat în cele mai neșteptate locuri, Cădere s-a impus drept unul dintre cei mai originali artiști conceptuali și performativi din arta contemporană, fiind în prezent artistul român cu cea mai mare circulație, pe plan mondial, după Brâncuși.</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/44264f42-dfd9-4c72-bb60-605b578257a2.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/583d25f3-639c-42a4-bf48-549d4c7b5fe5.png">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/5a019dd8-2e7d-4615-a95d-224520852e30.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/57174502-4901-4b4d-a4c8-b4248cae88a0.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a164c8c1-fce0-4120-8f7b-b6e47808b164.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f75dca66-e1df-4428-af79-44ea724affea.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b5f4c44a-406d-498e-89b7-50d343e61af4.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2294662c-a776-4c42-9964-f66a469dabb7.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c330119c-58e6-4c17-8c0c-7bfdc2eee25a.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2c03110e-39de-4c19-9c32-ffe5ec980038.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dc50c97a-0e04-47dc-8a88-70897a3a5b7e.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/93154efa-a40c-4f64-a42d-f0fdee369fcb.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/33e8b969-5bff-41fe-8a50-a2627a8700b9.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bdb56682-d5dd-44b2-9587-cde96d6b543f.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/03fa61ff-91d7-4699-a2b3-2f6f70f13576.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8d5c8619-fea1-4ab9-ba40-36a1f4b52bf9.jpg">]]></description>

It was a global triumph_ a narrative explored with diverse translations, creating a visual display in various mediums_ painting, sculpture, photography, and multimedia platforms_ artistic voices heard through the most personal of presentations.</p>,<p>In this 2nd edition, at the impressive the Mdina Cathedral Museum, over 30 works were presented throughout the treasury. The interplay of the works, installed on different landings, led the viewer on a spiritual traverse_ and to the cavernous underground passageway leveled below_ an ethereal space in itself.</p>,<p>With an invitation to participate, I delight in the bonds of friendship that were made through this distinctive and highly creative opportunity. Thus, I am proud to share this journey, and thank all the wonderful artists, academics, clergy and business entities, as well as visitors that have made this not only an exhibition, but a forum for its timely theme of conflicting spiritualities, an important one.</p>,<p><strong>The Artists_ The Works</strong></p>,<p><strong>Savina Capecci</strong> (in art Savina Kapecci)_ lives in Pordenone Italy, and studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Venice where she received her B.A. in Painting in 2014 and her Master Degree in 2016 with full marks. She worked as assistant to the professors in the classes of painting at the Free Academy of Fine Arts in Klagenfurt, Austria as well as participating in selected exhibitions.</p>,<p>Capecci has received several art awards with her work included in a variety of publications.</p>,<ul><li>Premio Arte Cairo Mondadori Finalists exhibition, Palazzo Reale and Palazzo della Permanente, Milan</li><li>Transgenic Attack, Atelier der Stadt Klagenfurt, Austria solo exhibition</li><li>BV Sommerausstellung, BV Galerie, Klagenfurt, Austria</li><li>Memento Andy, Atelier 3+10, Venice</li><li>Fuori Uso, Avviso di garanzia, Ex Tribunal, Pescara</li><li>Premio Lilian Caraian, Museum of Modern Art Revoltella, Trieste</li><li>Incident III – Accident Czestochowa Museum, Poland</li></ul>,<p>The works presented at the Mdina Biennale are titled “The PromiSSed land”. The painted images depict the human aspect of the current immigration crisis happening in the Mediterranean sea, and are expressive of the essence of the concept of “waiting” in all its forms and feelings that arise while sitting in a boat. The Promised land inevitably becomes a “pro-missed” land.</p>,<p><a href="http://www.savinakapecci.com/">www.savinakapecci.com</a> / <a href="http://savina_capecci@libero.it/savinakapecci@gmail.com">savina_capecci@libero.it</a> / <a href="http://savina_capecci@libero.it/savinakapecci@gmail.com">savinakapecci@gmail.co</a>m</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6eec7083-3d2d-4804-9412-79847f6754e8.jpg">,<p>Courtesy of the artist_ <strong>The PromiSSed land</strong></p>,<p>+</p>,<p><strong>James Alec Hardy_ </strong>born – 1979 in Colchester, England. The essence of James Alec Hardy’s practice is a process concerned with the impact of technologies on our experience of life. Since 2002, he has focused on analogue video systems, manifesting ideas through performance, sculpture, installation and print. By using obsolete devices from a former analogue age to reproduce digital functions, Hardy’s practice is challenging and engaging_ranging from building sculptural totems of video monitors, to 3 month long shamanic residencies in fields with I-Cabin, to 3 day long noise and feedback performances at The Tate Modern.</p>,<p>“With the truth being understood as subjective, the video sculptures I create do not limit freedom of thought, but stimulate choice. I aim to avoid manipulating the viewer by presenting ‘video as truth’, my work allows the video to function ultimately as the meditative stage for the mind, which unravels its own truth.”</p>,<p>1999-2002: Camberwell College of Arts, London<br>Present: Warrior Studios, London Represented by Kristin Hjellegjerde Gallery London</p>,<p>instagram @jamesalechardy / <a href="http://www.sitbackandrelapse.com/">www.sitbackandrelapse.com</a></p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c44906c9-5b83-4891-8986-69dd21bbaca9.jpg">,<p>Courtesy of the artist_<strong>“171111”</strong></p>,<p>+</p>,<p><strong>Robert Stokowy_ </strong>is a sound artist, composer and artistic researcher from Cologne, Germany. His work entails experimental compositions, text based interventions, audiovisual performances and installations. All projects are framed by an overarching artistic research process, focussing on topics of instability, sensory balance, as well as qualitative characteristics and potentiality of sound and place. Stokowy’s site-specific Sound Installations are based on phenomenological practices and consist of small sounds which hold very haptic and organic qualities. With his works the artist wants to explore the potentiality of his sonic surroundings and give recipients access to experience new perspectives on their environment.</p>,<p>Since Stokowy’s work is first and foremost based on sound, a recording of the installation is available on his website.</p>,<p>Instagram: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/robertstokowy/">robertstokowy</a> / www.robert-stokowy.de</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d9046899-eeb7-4fdd-a7b2-5b0ea6bd84c1.jpg">,<p>Courtesy of the artist_ <strong>structures [mdina]</strong></p>,<p>+</p>,<p><strong>Anthony Catania_</strong> is a visual artist specializing in myths and fables. Often on the threshold of grotesque figurative painting, his style attempts to capture subversively idiosyncratic portraits of legendary beings embedded in bizarrely anachronistic settings. His personal exhibitions; <em>Selve Oscure</em>, <em>The Cave of Centaurs</em>, <em>The Piper’s Requiem</em>, <em>Spectre-Bark</em> and <em>Last Light</em>, were held at the Malta Museum of Fine Arts, the Malta Maritime Museum and Heritage Malta. Catania is a PhD candidate at the University of Malta, where he also received his MFA in Digital Arts with a distinction. Catania also worked as a concept designer for indie games<em>, </em>poster designer for theatre productions and illustrator of academic book covers. He currently lectures on illustration, primitivism and sequential art at the University of Malta.</p>,<p><em>Wilting Annunciation</em> depicts the typical scene where the angel Gabriel announces the birth of Christ and incarnation of God. The announcement is that of Christ’s passion endured for humanity’s redemption from the agony in the garden of Gethsemane until His death on Calvary. It also depicts the passion of a Mater Dolorosa who will cradle the corpse of her son through fertile/dead sunflower seeds. Death and life are depicted in an oxymoronic manner.</p>,<p>www.anthonycatania.com</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3729e946-5f23-4a31-8d71-b3a08cb76f74.jpg">,<p>Courtesy of the artist_ <strong>Wilting Annunciation</strong></p>,<p>+</p>,<p><strong>Gor Chahal_ </strong>was born in Moscow in 1961 and is one of the most highly accomplished contemporary artists. His creative method synthesizes a scholastic approach with the elements of a ritual. Chahal is of a type rarely found in the Russian artistic community: a «universal master», with a diploma in science and applied mathematics, from the Moscow Engineering and Physics Institute, a contributor to numerous creative experiments undertaken in cooperation with groups of poets, musicians, and artists of Soviet-era Underground. But while the style of Chahal’s creations lie within the parameters of Actual Art, yet in substance they are at the other end of the spectrum. His themes often encompass faith and show a deep awareness that true art simply cannot exist without connection to tradition of the sacred, Christianity in this case.</p>,<p>mail@chahal.ru</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2db1a211-836f-4df9-92ae-0d9b8fb23bd6.jpg">,<p>Courtesy of the artist_<strong>St. George strikes Cy Twombly, 2017</strong></p>,<p>+</p>,<p><strong>Michael von Cube_ </strong>Born – 1952, Cube lives and works in Munich, Lower-Bavaria and Malta.</p>,<p>The reality of the political situation in the Mediterranean surpasses the image of brutality by far, and so the picture remains what it should be and is – a helpless plea: art.</p>,<p>When Johann Wolfgang von Goethe set off on his travels to Italy, the Age of Enlightenment was of great significance in Europe. The education system and lifestyle of the ancient world was seen as the model for a civil society. Committed to ‚Goodness, Truth and Beauty‘ (Winckelmann), artists and romantics from all walks of like were drawn to the cradle of European culture: The Mediterranean. The painter Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein created the famous portrait of the German writer entitled „Goethe in the Roman Campagna“.</p>,<p>‘Europium‘ takes an ironic look at this idealistic approach or what is indeed left of it today: The princess of peace and her system of values surrounded by lemons symbolising a united Europe. It refers to the vision of the writer, Goethe, just like peace-game‘ does to the abolition of violence and war.</p>,<p>www.michael-von-cube.de</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b58a36d7-d793-4b49-af8f-90168fd46e9e.jpg">,<p>Courtesy of the artist_<strong>Europium</strong></p>,<p>+</p>,<p><strong>Guy Ferrer_ </strong>is French, of Catalan and Italian descent.

Ferrer has worked in Paris, Los Angeles and other international cities, including New York, Caracas, Lima, Beijing and Johannesburg where he has created temporary studios. In 2012, the establishment of his studio in French Catalonia marked his return to the Mediterranean.</p>,<p>Recent honours include a monumental bronze sculpture for the French embassy in Singapore and a large fresco for the French embassy in Bakou (Azerbaijan).

She is also interested on the impact their existence have in our society, in particular architecture, politics and gender roles. Steel is Pereira’s material of choice – its chemical properties and reactions determine the subject of the work. She combines this metal with other materials in order to activate or counteract their intrinsic properties.</p>,<p>Pereira completed her Masters at Chelsea College of Arts in 2012, being awarded with Clifford Chance Prize the following year. In 2014, Pereira received the Royal British Society of Sculptors Bursary.

It does so for minutes, for hours, for days. There’s no aim in sight, not even a fata morgana. Synchronously a timepiece slowly but surely is wandering across the scene. While at first glance the character seems to be driven by customary stress and inner conflicts, it turns out that the piece is tackling the more sensitive issues of modern societies. If the attire of the character is any indication, it’s about civilization at large, which in the eyes of many people is at stake these days. Maybe the artist wants to remind us of two facts: 1. People on this planet have been running along the surface of the earth’s crust in search for paradise for ages. 2. It’s the Mediterranean, which once again is the arena of the world’s greatest conflicts.</p>,<p><a href="http://www.lapschina.com/">www.LAPSCHINA.com</a></p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d2d1243d-5de5-4af8-8d1e-8f05ef3fd653.jpg">,<p>Courtesy of the artist_ <strong>Runtime</strong> / site-specific three-channel video installation with sound; dimensions variable. 2017</p>,<p>+</p>,<p><strong>Aleko Lomadze_ </strong>is a Georgian artist whose work is iconographic in nature.

She explores, for example, how, in an ever increasingly technological world, we can often lose sight of our identities. In turn, we observe how everything seems to revolve around the media and the trials of character that come with this, us now having to learn the difference between what can be useful and what can be dangerous, whether our sources of information can be trusted.</p>,<p>Having lived in London for well over a decade, Maria is also able to use this cultural hub as a rich source of inspiration for many of her works. Transposing the communities she observes there onto canvas or computer, Maria journeys through what it means to live in a multicultural society and all the highs and lows that come with it, living surrounded by vibrant peoples from a variety of origins.</p>,<p>With this in mind, she continues to investigate how persons can be drowned out by the sound of the city, what it means to lose your voice in the crowd and the effects this can have on your self.</p>,<p>With years of experience already behind her, the necessity for a togetherness between peoples seems a clear solution to some of such problems that Maria raises in her work. Art, however, cannot only be interpreted in one way or be deemed understood with but one solution. Instead, Maria's work allows for many morals and meanings to be open for the onlooker, with significance for many years to come.</p>,<p><a href="http://www.mariakaleta.com/">www.mariakaleta.com</a>&nbsp;/<a href="mailto:mariakaleta@gmail.com">mariakaleta@gmail.com</a></p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ffd8a5c3-7cd4-45a7-8261-a97d0aab38e2.jpg">,<p>Courtesy of the artist_<strong>Silence, 2017&nbsp;</strong></p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Nudes in the Forest]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Nudes in the Forest</h1>,<p>Elijah Burgher vernisaj at Ivan Gallery in Bucharest</p>,<p>By Eugen Berlo</p>,<p>I had the pleasure of meeting and discussing with Elijah at his first show in Bucharest at <a href="http://www.ivangallery.com/en/exhibition/47/nudes-in-the-forest" title="">IvanGallery</a> the other day. Born in 1978, Kingston, NY, USA, he is an American artist in residency at <a href="http://hortongallery.com/residency/" title="">Horton Gallery studio</a> in Berlin, Germany.  Burgher works with the language of mag­ic and the mystical seals and symbols to address sex­u­al­i­ty, the nude subject and its capacity to convey meaning. Most of his presented artworks are luscious prints on paper realized with handmade heavyweight paper stencils and printmaking techniques. </p>,<p><em>“Titles are important, they’re like breadcrumb trails. The nude is an age-old subject of art. Most crucially for me, the nude has frequently served as a vehicle for expressing love, desire, and beauty, as well as erotic frenzy, terror and pain. The sigils represent desire too, and, like an aroused or arousing nude, they appear in the red alphabet blushing, hot and bothered, full-frontal or spread-eagle, totally naked. I am hoping that the title will be reminiscent of the well-known Baudelaire poem, “Correspondences”, which features the phrase, “forêts de symboles,” usually translated into english as “symbol forest” or “forest of symbols,” but also “cabalistic wood.” I enjoy contemplating being lost in a forest of symbols, of going for a walk in Grunewald, for instance, and seeing the tree branches spell out strange signs, or, alternatively, experiencing Kottbusser Tor, so full of blinking signage, as a wilderness, a place in which to lose oneself. Chants, of course, are simple, repetitive songs or intonations used in ritual. I enjoy the implication that the Chants are the voices of the Nudes, or that there are chanting voices in the forest.“ (Elijah Burgher)</em></p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9fa66920-1c46-49f0-84db-fa68080cc264.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/333d3f12-e153-457c-9cb6-cce3e0f9262c.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4f1b7358-33ee-4ce7-9b69-46d5049252cc.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4bfef27e-30f5-4c4a-b49a-801588df8dae.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8bc3e47c-0ab2-4acb-b031-49a1b6d6ca75.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f2dc41b1-c0e0-4443-a995-2ac93cb58b83.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c2c2ecf8-a355-4379-8b80-f0f6a458d5a8.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/71bedb07-8788-4c2b-8420-53754edcfb6e.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/210f3361-ac1f-4090-a2dc-da93d29f0ce4.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c188476b-24a0-440c-b294-cf44e5383daa.jpg">]]></description>

The group show is also a statement by Raluca Soaita and Andrei Breahna. As I like to follow up with a few galleries, I have (Yahveh) to say go and see it!; it is a good one and it will please you to see a nice range of artists, from Razvan Anton, Pavel Braila, Radu Cioca, to Tania Mouraud, Karolina Bregula and Mircea Stanescu. Many thanks to Răzvan Băbiceanu who walked me through.</p>,<p>“This public showing is the way Raluca Soaita and Andrei Breahna responsibly position themselves as related to the artists hosted by their gallery. The constant presence of video in the public space, the American-school photo, the drawing, the installation, the performance, the animation – they all have shaped a certain artist / intellectual profile in the gallery space, one bearing various practices, which EASTWARDS PROSPECTUS is supporting and developing. The exhibition is a coherent and clear discourse about the gallerist/artist relationship, about the exhibition space and the challenges raised by certain works that one feels connected to.” - <a href="https://www.eastwardsprospectus.com/seeing-ourselves-sensing/" title="">read more</a></p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3510b18d-1e6a-48ec-8f4c-12f2ee6a07cb.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e6aeb1dc-063d-4eb7-a234-b305279ddce3.jpg">,<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/aeba9f7c122a122ec25a472d791f6df13cd796c2.jpg">,<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9f1ba5716af1f75bbf2ae5a6f03e81bc8edf0a7c.jpg">,<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fc4a1fc35947c2e2156c983e016e9688f926eefb.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/acb7798c-88e6-4868-92eb-db6122dc9b4b.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f6994efd-b6c7-4183-83e3-07bbe2feb42a.jpg">,<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/bf16a9ef308175a715d956ce43cbabd9017c6a54.jpg">,<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/393b6492d15c9a9d4340d256f2ce5331c28fce66.jpg">,<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f655a44479baaacc58b018858346076e41989cc1.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/5caa1632-a961-4514-86ca-f4645a4074a2.jpg">,<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/974d1fd1702e89d17a9c42cc7f7726afdfa11109.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e61fc732-5a40-48c6-8508-59d7936a150f.jpg">,<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/7d5d821221041d2104a4f863120a7680147f11d5.jpg">]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/230d71a0-bf45-4e12-b4d3-c02e939c0ce8.png">,<h1>in memoriam /abbas 1944 – 2018</h1>,<p>by Renay Elle Morris </p>,<p>©&nbsp;Reprinted from 08 April 1999 /&nbsp;<em>Picture</em>&nbsp;magazine_&nbsp;<strong>Abbas. A State of Grace &nbsp;/&nbsp;</strong>Renay Elle&nbsp;Morris</p>,<p>From the country of a thousand and one nights, one journalist’s ambitious reportage covering twenty nine countries in four continents.</p>,<p>It was the brilliance of Allah O Akbar: A Journey Through Militant Islam (Phaidon 1994) that took my breath away. Its author, Abbas, has been described as one of the few photographers “who can raise photojournalism to an art form.” I met Abbas one rainy March afternoon in Magnum Photo’s Paris bureau. We spoke briefly; he was guarded and I was somewhat intimidated. I sipped black coffee while he questioned me, thinking that you’d have to be an armadillo to engage him in conversation–his dark piercing eyes, almost blinding if you are in his line of vision. Then in an instant, relief. He flashes a smile, and everything softens, a gentler Abbas appears. He cracks a joke, something about a journalist, a paparazzi, a tiger and a rat. I take in the humor, albeit dry and biting, but humor, nonetheless.</p>,<p><strong>_I have to improve my tactics so that every villager is flattered at being photographed.</strong></p>,<p>While Abbas is carefully scrutinizing images for his new book on Christianity, I am making notes for a possible interview at a later date. This proved not to be an easy task, with countless phone calls to Paris and London from New York. Laughing, he accused me of harassment. “Not at all,” I said, explaining that he was so illusive–moving quickly, ever so quickly. True, he was not an easy target, but then he was a master of that game having been trained so well in the killing fields of the third world. To Abbas, there is no time to waste. He is as fleeting as the images he seeks to document. I asked him, “Who is Abbas, really?” To which he replied, modestly, “Just a photographer.” Too simple an answer for me. No, he’s not just a photographer. He is a journalist who has covered major political and social events–Biafra, Bangladesh, Vietnam, South Africa, The Middle East. A journalist who, in 1987, made an ambitious study–a seven year project photographing the resurgence of Islam throughout the world with some of the most chilling and haunting essays ever recorded and captured in Iran: La Revolution Confisquee (Editions Cletrat 1980) and Return To Mexico-Journey’s Beyond the Mask (Norton, 1992), photographs of the same intensity and consistency. Images that dare to speak to us of outrage and courage. Images of fear, of war, of burdens so heavy they are almost unbearable to look at. A journalist who wears sensible shoes, who plays the game–moving and shooting his subjects with such fervor that at the end of the day, there is nothing left but to succumb to exhaustion.</p>,<p><strong>_My relationship with God is purely professional.</strong></p>,<p>That is the brilliance of Abbas. He is a man of contradictions who cites Rembrandt as a mentor, walks the paths of great novelists and chronicles his photographs with pages and pages of poetic script so compelling they breath a life of their own.</p>,<p>Renay Morris: You are revered by your colleagues, to some you are considered a hero. Who is Abbas and do you believe in heroes?</p>,<p>Abbas: (Laughing.)  I am simply a photographer. C’est tout. Be careful, heroes are something else. I can’t talk about heroes, but I can talk about the people that influenced me as a photographer. Rembrandt. I learned a lot from Rembrandt. And from Velazquez.</p>,<p>RM: From painters more so than photographers?</p>,<p>Abbas: Oh yes, much more. I was visiting a museum in Amsterdam, and room after room I saw portraits of the bourgeois–the well-to-do people of Amsterdam by Rembrandt and other painters as well. I was struck by how Rembrandt did not just freeze his characters like other painters, he suspended them. Freezing means you stop them in their action. They are literally posing. Suspending means that after you have photographed or painted your subjects they keep on doing what they were doing before. When I started in 1970 I realized that this was exactly what I was doing­ or what I was trying to do–not to freeze people in my photos, but to suspend them. What I learned from Velazquez was his amazing composition, his sense of proportion and the way he uses light.</p>,<p>RM: Your subject matter is very dark–a mass of darkness. No smiles, it’s all very macabre.</p>,<p>Abbas: You are asking me to explain my work. It is hard for a photographer to critique his own work. It is for critics to tell me what is there. Perhaps this intensity has something do with my background as an Iranian. I am, of course, the product of my culture–my education, my past. I left Iran as a small boy, but I went back for the revolution which I covered for two years. This was a very intense time because I was not only a photographer, but I was an involved photographer. You see, when I go to Zaire or I go to Vietnam or Cuba, I am concerned, but not involved. Iran was my country, my people, and my revolution–in the beginning at least. Therefore, photography wasn’t just recording other people’s lives, it was also recording my own life or my own wishes.</p>,<p><strong>_When I am working I am not in a normal state, I am in a state of grace.</strong></p>,<p>RM: The little Mexican boy before his funeral…the prostitute’s cadaver…you’re tough. Photo after photo of death and violence and suffering. In Allah o Akbar you start out with death and you end with death. You write: “Will violence always hold a fascination for me.”</p>,<p>Abbas: I’m glad you mentioned that. Death is part of life. Perhaps, because of my background and the life I led in Iran and Mexico, there is all sorts of reasons I have this fascination with death and violence. Death is eternity. Violence is life. In 1997, after 17 years I went back to Iran. I remember a time when I was literally in the middle of this crowd of Iranians celebrating the martyrdom of Hassan and Hussein–the prophet’s grandsons. They were beating their chests and singing at the same time–the songs of mourning. Suddenly, I was taken by the whole mood of the situation. I was no longer an observer. Whether I liked it or not, it was part of my culture and I became acutely aware of the fact that I was heir to 3,000 years of this culture-a culture with violent rituals.</p>,<p>RM: And the religious imagery that appears in the majority of your work…</p>,<p>Abbas: My relationship with God is purely professional. After photographing all these years I don’t understand why people believe, so I am still fascinated by religion.</p>,<p>RM: And the contractions. The surprise element, a non-violent Abbas photo or phrase…like when you refer to the beauty of the flowers and the Rose of Kabul.</p>,<p>Abbas: Every man is a contradiction. I hope you are a contradiction yourself. Again, this all so subjective. When I look at my contact sheets I see contractions I don’t see when I am shooting, because shooting is very intuitive and editing is intellectual. There are many levels of contractions; like the two women on the beach in Morocco–one in a bikini , one covered in traditional dress. That is a simple one. There are other levels of contractions and complexity. I seek that. I think that photography is not just recording an event. For me it is also interpreting an event and giving you feeling about this event.</p>,<p>RM: You write: “One of the best way to get to know a country or a place is always through its novelists.”</p>,<p>Abbas: That’s true. That’s what I normally do when I am travelling. I read the heavy stuff beforehand; the sociology, the economics, the politics. Then I find English or French books by the prominent writers of that particular country I am exploring. They guide me. Actually, very much so, because maybe in a way this is what I’m trying to do as a photographer. Photography means writing with light. That is exactly what I do–write with light. Like a someone who uses the written word to capture a subject, I don’t only work on a subject, I work around a subject…beyond the subject. Working four years on Christianity and seven years on Islam and three years on Mexico–this is not the normal lifestyle of a photojournalist. It’s more like that of the writer. Also, I always keep a diary and parts of this diary go with my pictures in my books. I try not to write about my photographs, but write about the environment in which I took the photographs.</p>,<p><strong>_Iran was my country, my people, and my revolution–at the beginning at least. Therefore, photography wasn’t just recording other people’s lives, it was also recording my own life or my own wishes.</strong></p>,<p>RM: The Hadj–the pilgrimage to Mecca. How difficult was that to photograph?</p>,<p>Abbas: It took me five years and one war to actually get the visa. The Saudis did not make the life of the photographer easy, but I managed to get the photos I wanted. I had to go there three times. Each time I was not happy with the situation so I kept going until I got what I wanted. I am as demanding of myself as I am of others. RM: So much so that you may resort to trickery to get your pictures. In Return to Mexico, I quote you: “I have to improve my tactics so that every villager is flattered at being photographed.” Do subjects need to be seduced?</p>,<p>Abbas: When a photographer goes to a situation like in this Mexican village, he is not innocent. He carries a whole other culture on his back. Whether he likes it or not he represents the Western world–the gringo. Although I’m not American to their eyes I was a gringo journalist. So there was no reason for them to be kind to me. I had to seduce them with a lot of polaroids at the beginning. I took their pictures and gave the photos to them. I sort of became the official photographer of the village. After a while they started asking me to photograph their festivals and give them prints It was not easy, it was very confrontational.</p>,<p>RM: How do you handle criticism?</p>,<p>Abbas: Well, there is not enough of it.</p>,<p>RM: Not enough of it?</p>,<p>Abbas: That’s right I wish I would get more.</p>,<p>RM: Tell me about the Christianity book­–your new project. What compelled you to do it?</p>,<p>Abbas: It is set for a publication release in the Spring of 2000. I just finished shooting the photography and I am now in the process of editing the work. I’ve done the basic work in my head. It’s just a question of putting it to form. I started Islam because it was, in a way, natural for me to do it. After following the revolution of Iran, it was normal for me to not only look at the revolution but also the ways this revolution was affecting the world. When I was finishing my project on Islam, I was thinking about what I was going to do next. I decided to stay with God, but then just change prophets. Because, when you look at Christianity or religion in general, it is a just a way to look into our societies. Religion is just the pretext. Religion is just not faith, it is culture, it is economy…it is many things. I hope to make it similar to the book on Islam.</p>,<p>RM: Your books are always in black and white. How do you feel about the use of color.</p>,<p>Abbas: My expression is in black and white for a very simple reason. Because I see in black and white. When I am working I am not in a normal state, I am in a state of grace. I automatically convert yellows greens and browns into shades of grey blacks and white. But I have to cover the color stories wanted by international magazines. It is not easy to accept the assignments and remain master of my time.</p>,<p>RM: How has your work changed over the years. Abbas: I’m the same photographer, but with more maturity now. Your asking me to judge my photography again?</p>,<p>RM: Yes I am.</p>,<p>Abbas: The difference is I know exactly what I want now. When you start out, it is normal to experiment. But after 30 years I am not experimenting that much. I don’t like to shift different styles or different interests. My work is pretty consistent. My signature, my style is recognizable.</p>,<p>RM: I understand you have an up-coming exhibition.</p>,<p>Abbas: Yes, I am having an exhibition in Brussels. This is my first one. I was supposed to have an exhibition before on the book on Islam. But, because of the whole controversy and sensitive nature of the work, people were afraid to show my work on wars. The exhibit is from April 22 – June 22 at the Chapel of Charles The Fifth. Can you imagine that…an exhibition on Islam in a Chapel?</p>,<p>RM: Is that another contradiction? So, at the end of the day, do you think that it might be said that you persist until you prevail? A serious pause ensues.</p>,<p>Abbas: Perhaps, because I never take no for an answer. My personal life may be different, but when I am working I never take no for an answer.</p>,<p>RM: Well I did not take no for an answer either, and that is why I got this interview. I hope you don’t think I was harassing you–I hope you were joking. Any words of wisdom for those starting out.</p>,<p>Abbas: Just what I told you. Don’t take no for answer. And a secondary piece of advice, get a pair of good walking shoes–a very good pair.</p>,<p>For further reading &nbsp;and information_ Magnum Photos at&nbsp;www.magnumphotos.com</p>]]></description>
