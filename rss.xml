            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Mushroom House by Yoshitomo Nara on artnet Auctions</h1><p>The present woodcut is from the very small edition of 25, making it highly sought-after. Yoshitomo Nara's Mushroom House portrays a childlike scene with a sweet and cartoonish central figure. The layers of the roof of the home are interrupted by what appears to be a young child's head curiously sandwiched between the thatched, brightly colored mushroom-like layers.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/cb99da06f2e04cbb21b2d5ea0cae442c/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.artnet.com%2Faoa_lot_images%2F117559%2Fyoshitomo-nara-mushroom-house-prints-and-multiples-zoom_550_790.jpg"></article>]]></description>
