            <description><![CDATA[<h1>'SEEING OURSELVES SENSING' by Eastwards Prospectus</h1>,<p>by Eugen Berlo 2017-07-15</p>,<p>Tomorrow is the last day, but it’s worth to make an appointment and pay a visit to the gallery. The group show is also a statement by Raluca Soaita and Andrei Breahna. As I like to follow up with a few galleries, I have (Yahveh) to say go and see it!; it is a good one and it will please you to see a nice range of artists, from Razvan Anton, Pavel Braila, Radu Cioca, to Tania Mouraud, Karolina Bregula and Mircea Stanescu. Many thanks to Răzvan Băbiceanu who walked me through.</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3510b18d-1e6a-48ec-8f4c-12f2ee6a07cb.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e6aeb1dc-063d-4eb7-a234-b305279ddce3.jpg">,<img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/2b2431f8e7ba7b0/3d04d072a8f09984443bf8855c653e58/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=3264&cropwidth=2448&degrees=-90&input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F8dd0736c-a9e7-4bdb-becb-c9715c9fe878.jpg&x=0&y=0">,<img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/2b2431f8e7ba7b0/02a9057dcc3b5b66df5282ecf650556c/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=3264&cropwidth=2448&degrees=-90&input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fab69a330-f37e-490f-8c45-f63db7b2cd07.jpg&x=0&y=0">,<img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/2b2431f8e7ba7b0/3ae41e4fd52675c3c5abe499f1b47867/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=3264&cropwidth=2448&degrees=-90&input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F9eb0776c-0277-4309-8b95-d44af51fab0a.jpg&x=0&y=0">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/acb7798c-88e6-4868-92eb-db6122dc9b4b.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f6994efd-b6c7-4183-83e3-07bbe2feb42a.jpg">,<img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/2b2431f8e7ba7b0/2ebd01142657c160c818d4e6191be565/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=3264&cropwidth=2448&degrees=-90&input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fee4f519b-b3bb-4936-beaa-ac9da2c24efa.jpg&x=0&y=0">,<img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/2b2431f8e7ba7b0/2dfb39605e5df1bffec2f6267683d6fd/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=3264&cropwidth=2448&degrees=-90&input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F96788b98-9f54-4998-9843-c2d5830794a5.jpg&x=0&y=0">,<img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/2b2431f8e7ba7b0/ed774eb43e25ec9325aa7ecf2365689f/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=3264&cropwidth=2448&degrees=-90&input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ff9689e53-8ab2-4912-ad63-671366a2b1c3.jpg&x=0&y=0">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/5caa1632-a961-4514-86ca-f4645a4074a2.jpg">,<img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/2b2431f8e7ba7b0/6d4c7b7dc8430c8096fc873b3a32ba1b/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=3264&cropwidth=2448&degrees=-90&input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F3b0ddafb-f029-46bc-a55a-c88c1a4010a8.jpg&x=0&y=0">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e61fc732-5a40-48c6-8508-59d7936a150f.jpg">,<img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/2b2431f8e7ba7b0/42fdb4ea57d95271df10c7c7e375693a/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=3264&cropwidth=2448&degrees=-90&input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F4f68c2b0-9b92-4d1b-9353-de99415a89f1.jpg&x=0&y=0">,<blockquote>This public showing is the way Raluca Soaita and Andrei Breahna responsibly position themselves as related to the artists hosted by their gallery. The constant presence of video in the public space, the American-school photo, the drawing, the installation, the performance, the animation &ndash; they all have shaped a certain artist / intellectual profile in the gallery space, one bearing various practices, which EASTWARDS PROSPECTUS is supporting and developing. The exhibition is a coherent and clear discourse about the gallerist/artist relationship, about the exhibition space and the challenges raised by certain works that one feels connected to.</blockquote>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Tomás Saraceno]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Tomás Saraceno</h1>,<p>Art and science are often described as two opposing disciplines. Looking at the practice of the Argentinian artist and trained architect Tomás Saraceno, such a differentiation is quickly disproved. Climbing atop one of his larger-than-life installations feels like becoming part of a scientific speculation about alternative habitats, letting one sense the often disregarded correlation of the human body and its environment in a new way. From his Cloud Cities projects, to installations such as In Orbit and On Space Time Foam and his experiments around spiderwebs and aerosolar journeys, the common thread in Tomás’ works lies in a life lifted off the ground.</p>,<p>“I’ve been studying architecture and this is a discipline where you deal a lot with people. I remember Vito Acconci once said to me, “Don’t you come from a discipline that builds sculptures for humans?” What I am doing has never really been architecture, but what has always been at the center of my practise is incorporating the human scale and the relation of human bodies. And I was always more drawn to the experimental side of architecture or practices such as the one of Gordon Matta-Clark.”</p>,<p>continue reading on <a href="http://www.freundevonfreunden.com/interviews/tomas-saraceno-wants-to-fly-while-keeping-his-feet-on-the-ground/" title="">fvf</a></p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c97e621f-cfc6-4b72-ab89-4e32faa8a9e9.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/96dd1032-1e32-4ac8-88ab-f0f27ca47d84.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f8d1ad36-ae2c-4a49-9316-0c053bf4caad.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/df94ef3b-271e-48bd-b7fb-6bab39ae8258.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7d5f4c23-a47a-4900-bc11-98d75bafed7e.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fbad3c67-1da9-4b07-b9e1-19d889113dfd.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f6f6237b-e57a-41cc-99d6-9d6e0bbca486.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/57148a70-d8d0-416c-80f0-2670cbb52ed8.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8dcdb01b-bcde-43bb-9631-7d75094549cd.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/922d8d0f-6677-4739-abd9-134743a9dc89.jpg">]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Georg Baselitz]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Georg Baselitz</h1>,<p>Brilliant, urgent and provocative, German artist Georg Baselitz is among the most celebrated artists of his time. His engagement with German national identity at a time when many artists were shying away from so difficult a subject was an extraordinary act of self-assertion. Much of his best work appears hideous, unsettling, and in some cases even crude. But there is far more to Baselitz’s paintings and art prints than first meets the eye, and their apparent coarseness camouflages their own astonishing levels of accomplishment. He has famously experimented with mediums, shifting between drawing, wooden sculpture, and painting. Prominent works include the&nbsp;<em>Fracture</em>&nbsp;paintings of the late 60s, which contain echoes of his life in divided Germany, but he is perhaps best known for his iconic upside-down paintings, in which the artist inverts the subject matter in order to highlight the artifice of painting.</p>,<p><a href="https://fineartmultiple.com/georg-baselitz-art-prints-for-sale" title="">source</a></p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/738611c5-d614-4ce2-8e18-20daea1a2faf.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cf32844e-c8f0-4fe0-be12-02d381b4bb24.jpg">,<img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/2b2431f8e7ba7b0/6bd6a781f0a43af751a327bca822c022/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=500&cropwidth=275&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F2531cc8f-4e5b-4e2f-aeda-3b2bcf1a3cfc.jpg&x=53&y=0">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/32dd65f0-5262-46c1-8e55-7b1b693d2695.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ed2e4945-8d5b-42a5-81c5-dce32631853f.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/5b1edfad-c03b-4e94-8cce-ae84555f2ab7.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9329ea1c-b1e3-45d1-afe9-bf2ac1fe532b.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/31d6b788-d14e-4869-997f-eff0d9dd330b.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e84826a1-575d-45bf-b252-5fb02d098028.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2ff97e0f-712f-440a-ba36-96d198eeab31.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1cb2e748-9a8f-41de-8be0-9079c0247fb8.jpg">]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>THE CHERKASHIN’S. NEW DRAWINGS. A NEW CHAPTER.</h1>,<p>Renay Elle Morris / June 2017</p>,<p><strong>For decades, Valera and Natasha Cherkashin</strong> have added layer upon layer of philosophical and political ideology to their masterful works of photographic genius. With exhibitions, lectures and talks on an international stage, the art of their images have recently been compiled into a 254 page publication entitled, <strong>Actions, Happenings and art performances 1962 – 2016 _ Night with a Pioneer Leader</strong>, which delves into a history of 2 artists_a husband and wife team, and the legacy of their talent. What inspires them may not offer an easy answer. Perhaps it is a fearless energy to defend beliefs, or a lifetime of a Soviet regime. Perhaps it was Perestroika, the political movement and the "openness"policy that led to the reforms of the Soviet political and economic system during the1980s that allowed for such ambitious work.</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3df39e8c-e4a5-44a7-bc81-6191dc9c8271.jpg" title="&quot;Untitled 1&quot;">]]></description>

It was set up by Sanju Mathew. Nutmeg Editions welcomes and encourages innovative and experimental approaches to printmaking. We can guide and facilitate both experienced and relatively inexperienced printmakers; prior understanding of specific techniques is not a necessity. Nutmeg deals with all the practicalities of the printmaking process from start to finish. The technical support artists receive allows them the freedom and the confidence to develop ambitious ideas should they wish to.</p>,<p><a href="https://www.nutmegeditions.com/" title="">visit</a></p>]]></description>
