This is how I depict my pandas: they are fat, they have an open heart, their black and white colours are clearly delineated, and they live among stalks of bamboos. But I don&rsquo;t paint pandas for the sake of the pandas. What I want is to juxtapose bold black grids embracing pudgy white grids, tossing and turning &mldr; Pandas inspire me to search for disarray and eternity.&rdquo; &ndash; Wu Guanzhong">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a3bd5837-140a-4f94-9064-6dcaf2cf3ffb.jpg" title="Wu Guanzhong, Scenery of Zhangjiajie, Ink and Colour on Paper, 1979, Estimate HK$ 6,000,000-9,000,000." alt="During the autumn of 1979, Wu Guanzhong travelled to Changsha to create his large oil painting Shaoshan. Afterward, he travelled to Western Hunan to Fenghuang to paint its beauteous landscapes. There he had the sudden urge to paint in Zhangjiajie. This is how he recalled that journey: &ldquo;It was a simple road for vehicles for the purposes of forest protection. It was pretty bumpy, lined with stones and pebbles. Lorries would jerkily move along the road &mldr;">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b8ecd07c-c659-41a0-9835-76eed0bf91c0.jpg" title="(Left) Lin Fengmian, Fishing Boats at the Dock, Ink And Colour on Paper, Estimate HK$ 300,000-400,000. (Right) Lin Fengmian, Residence Perching on Cliff, Ink And Colour on Paper, Estimate HK$ 260,000-350,000." alt="These two works belonged to the founder of the Asia Society, Mr and Mrs John D.Rockefeller 3rd. They were originally gifts from Mr and Mrs Henry Luce, the founder of Time and Life magazines. Luce (1898&ndash;1967) was a staunch supporter of the Nationalist government during the Second World War, even visiting China in May 1941, meeting with Chiang Kai-shek in Chongqing...">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4515ce14-4f50-447f-9cf6-81d18c0ef3af.jpg" title="Lin Fengmian, Residence by the Stream, Ink and Colour on Paper, Estimate HK$ 2,000,000-3,000,000." alt="Although this work is not dated, looking at the style of the brushstrokes, signature and stamp, we can deduce it dates from the 1950s, comparable to Ladies in a Garden belonging to the Hong Kong Museum of Art. The treatment, especially the fine brushwork depicting every flower and plant, can only be traced to a short period during the painter&rsquo;s career that never recurred afterward....">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d4b97e31-0c6c-4718-82ec-ee591b04af76.jpg" title="(Left) Lin Fengmian, Four Magpies on the Branch, Ink And Colour on Paper, Estimate HK$ 1,400,000-1,800,000. (Right) Lin Fengmian, Autumn Woods, Ink And Colour on Paper, Estimate HK$ 1,600,000-2,000,000." alt="This series originates from noted Shanghai art connoisseur Wang Yiping&rsquo;s collection. Lin Fengmian left Shanghai for Hong Kong in October 1977. Two years later, Lin wrote to Wang Yiping and other friends, informing them that he wanted to donate the 105 paintings he left in Shanghai&rsquo;s China Art Academy to the Chinese government. ...">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d80c0e13-614d-49e6-b47b-ad86895fa0c8.jpg" title="Lin Fengmian, Still Life, Ink And Colour on Paper, Estimate HK$ 1,800,000-2,400,000." alt="This work belongs to the Cheng Xin Xuan Collection of 19th and 20th century paintings. Although the canvas was not signed, according to written records, it dates from 1957.">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2382f3f3-0db3-4d9c-94a0-a428af7a804a.jpg" title="Wu Guanzhong, Boating in Jiangnan, Ink and Colour on Paper, Estimate HK$ 2,800,000-4,000,000." alt="The water towns of Jiangnan with its winding rivers and bridges, no matter whether the hometown of Lu Xun or the famed locale of Yixing, are frequent subjects of Wu Guanzhong&rsquo;s output of the 1980s. Although this work belongs to that period, it is unusual in its composition and approach. In the foreground is a stone bridge that cuts across the width of the work with the river flowing below. ...">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a28a454a-2ec6-4d27-9bcd-a47b0452bf80.jpg" title="Xu Beihong, Galloping Horse, Ink On Paper, 1951, Estimate HK$ 2,200,000-3,000,000." alt="This painting was a gift from Xu Beihong to Li Rumian. During the Korean War, the painter suffered from bad health, finishing only a few works, although he tried his best to put ink on paper. This painting depicts a horse galloping in mid-air, as if it could traverse a thousand miles in a day. It is testament to Xu&rsquo;s immense level of energy of that moment. Perhaps this was given to Li as a token of support during the time when China was standing on the opposite side of America on the Korean peninsula...">]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Thomas Ruff</h1>,<p>In 2003, Thomas Ruff published a photographic collection of "Nudes" with a text by the French author Michel Houellebecq. Ruff's images here are based on Internet pornography, which was digitally processed and obscured without any camera or traditional photographic device. In 2009, the aperture Foundation in New York published <em>jpegs</em>, a large-scale book dedicated exclusively to his monumental series of pixelated enlargements of internet-culled images, all compressed using the standard JPEG format which intentionally uses JPEG artifacts. His <em>Substrat </em>series, based on images from Japanese manga and anime cartoons, continued this exploration of digitally altered Web-based pictures. However, he alters and manipulates the source material such that the work becomes an abstraction of forms and colors with no visual memory of the original source material. On February 7, 2011, one of his <em>Nudes </em>pictures appeared on the cover of New York Magazine.</p>,<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Ruff </p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9ad7a960-68f4-411d-9c0d-dc6d3100f249.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b0c847bb-3bf2-4cff-a05e-944db7a57431.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/add2c117-f094-478f-bb87-034765ce2acf.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4a614efc-625e-4cfc-b101-d3af301d46d8.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/25642c81-82bf-4ad7-b17a-86a0d4071fef.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4fda61ca-c7fd-4c98-9a2b-9a1ab60aebb8.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/abc109f2-5773-44b8-9cfc-9a271dc39e92.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/038bffd8-c9ae-4d84-a012-89158c50234d.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9e9d9333-205d-4bec-9319-06db75026b3a.jpg">,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/960bf0e0-8427-412b-beef-f8685e366e1b.jpg">]]></description>

Drawing is for me the most direct path towards a possible image. Memory is not the subject but the medium and drawing is a conscious choice of a medium beyond mediums, a language that has the advantage of keeping a safe distance from the norms of the art world. It is a continuous and open research that eludes conclusion. It is a process that leaves a trace. It is the trace of a thinking process and the image is its proof. The speed at which I think and observe is also the speed at which I draw. The mark, the path and the image belong to this visible process of constructing meaning. It is an imprecise and uncertain route meant to change, consolidate or contradict our views. It is a landscape of shifting geography where historical, political and personal elements hover relentlessly while searching for a state of balance.</p>,<p>Lucrez cu desenul și memoria. Desenul este pentru mine cel mai direct traseu către imagine. Memoria nu este subiectul, ci mediul, iar desenul reprezintă o alegere conștientă a unui mediu dincolo de medii, un limbaj care reușește să țină la distanță normele lumii artistice. Este o cercetare continuă și deschisă care eludează concluziile. Desenul este un proces care lasă urme, urme ale procesului de gândire, iar imaginea este proba. Durata petrecută gândind și observând este și durata petrecută desenând. Urma, traseul și imaginea aparțin acestui proces vizibilal construcției sensului. Este o cale nesigură și imprecisă menită să schimbe, să consolideze sau să contrazică ceea ce cunoaștem. Este peisajul unei geografii schimbătoare unde elementele istorice, politice și personale orbitează fără întrerupere în căutarea unei stări de echilibru.</p>]]></description>
