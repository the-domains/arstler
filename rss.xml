Rob Pruitt (American, b.1964) is a Post-Pop artist known for his take on youth and consumer culture. Born in Washington, D.C., Pruitt attended the Corcoran College of Art Design, and later transferred to Parsons School of Design after meeting and befriending educator and well-known fashion consultant Tim Gunn. Rob Pruitt blends a Pop sensibility with witty critiques of the art world. For his Art Awards (2009 and 2010), one of his more conceptual projects, Pruitt presented awards at the Guggenheim Museum in the manner of the Academy Awards; 101 Art Ideas You Can Do Yourself (2001) was a set of DIY ideas for art making, like "make a leaf out of paper and tape it to a tree" or "sell a collector a key to your house." In 2011, Pruitt made The Andy Monument, a ten-foot-tall silver statue of Andy Warhol presented as a public artwork in New York's Union Square. 30 x 38 in (76.2 x 96.52 cm) Technique: Seragraphic Prints With Enamel Ink And Micronic Mica Chips On Koshiji Japanese Paper Edition Size: 100 This artwork is signed</p>]]></description>
