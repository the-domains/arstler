            <title><![CDATA[Existentialism in Modern Art]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Existentialism in Modern Art</h1>,<p>The philosophy of Existentialism was an influential undercurrent in art that aimed to explore the role of sensory perception, particularly vision, in the thought processes. Existentialism stressed the special character of personal, subjective experience and it insisted on the freedom and autonomy of the individual. Jean-Paul Sartre was Existentialism's most prominent advocate in the post-war period, and the bohemian circles in which he moved while in Paris included many artists. In this way, figures such as Alberto Giacometti, Jean Dubuffet, Jean Fautrier and Wols became associated with Existentialist philosophy. It also had some impact in the United States, particularly through the writing of art critic Harold Rosenberg. The philosophy was often poorly understood, even by those who called themselves Existentialists. Nevertheless, it shaped discussion of themes such as trauma, anxiety, and alienation; ideas which were pervasive in post-war art.</p>,<h3>Key Ideas</h3>,<p>Existentialism first emerged in the late 19th century, in the writing of the Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard who reacted against the systematic and rational character of Hegel's philosophy and instead insisted on the distinctiveness of personal experience. In the decades that followed, Existentialism grew into a philosophy that placed stress on individual ethics and on the authentic experience of selfhood, on freedom and choice.Existentialism's focus on individual experience made it a perfect tool with which to interpret much post-war abstract art. It proved particularly useful to discuss Art Informel, the highly expressive and individualistic abstract art that flourished in Europe after the late 1940s. Some of this work, by painters such as Dubuffet and Wols, addressed the uneasy co-existence of mind and body on which human beings rely, and Existentialism's interest in sensory perception offered a means to negotiate the sometimes difficult divide.Existentialism never enjoyed the same popularity among American artists that it did among Europeans. But it did enter the discussions of Abstract Expressionists, particularly through Harold Rosenberg's notion of"Action Painting,"which understood the painter's creative process as an act of necessary self-assertion, an expression of freedom and authenticity.Existentialism also contributed to discussions of figurative art in the post-war period, shaping responses to the work of Alberto Giacometti and Francis Bacon in particular. This is symptomatic of the popularization of the philosophy, which came to be widely understood as the intellectual expression of anxiety about the fate of humanity in the atomic age…</p>,<p><a href="http://www.theartstory.org/definition-existentialism.htm" title="">on The Art Story</a></p>,<article><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a837e5e2ce75bf9efabb6eef8573389f77aa23fb.jpg"><h1>Existentialism in Modern Art - Modern Art Terms and Concepts</h1><p>The philosophy of Existentialism was an influential undercurrent in art that aimed to explore the role of sensory perception, particularly vision, in the thought processes.

            <title><![CDATA[Sculpture at Ilana Goor Museum]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Sculpture at Ilana Goor Museum</h1>,<p>For the first time in Israel, you have the opportunity to admire works of art from the point of view of the artist/collector rather than as exhibits in a sterile academic environment.</p>,<p>The <a href="http://www.ilanagoor.com/eng/The-Building/The-Building/">Ilana Goor Museum </a>is located in an 18th century building surrounded by the breathtaking landscape of the shoreline of Tel Aviv and the <a href="http://www.ilanagoor.com/eng/Tours/Guided-Tours/">Old Jaffa City</a>. Fascinating historical events are ensconced within the Museum's walls dating back to 280 years ago, when the building served as the first Jewish Inn for pilgrims on their way to Jerusalem. The Museum was restored based on its original building and boasts over 500 Israeli, international and Ethnic Art alongside Ilana Goor's creations.</p>,<p>In the Museum there is a large and fascinating collection of sculptures of various sizes, forms and materials, which were sculpted in different time periods by Ilana Goor, international artists, veteran and young Israeli artists. Amongst them are sculptures by the English sculptor Henry Moore, the Italian sculptor Diego Giacometti and the Russian sculptor Archipenko (Sculpture Room) as well as Yaakov Agam’s kinetic sculptures (Main Atrium), Yaacov Dorchin’s monumental sculptures (Design Room) and works by Yigal Tomarkin (Main Atrium) together with authentic sculptures by Dr Yosef Sapir, Ilana Goor’s grandfather (Library) and ancient Christian sculptures made of olive wood (Christian Room). Through our website, you can get a sense of some of the unique sculptures displayed exclusively in the Museum, and of the various spaces in which each and every painting is exhibited</p>,<p><a href="http://www.ilanagoormuseum.org/eng/" title="">visit</a></p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/098a8bc8-d3be-458c-89d6-88ef109ddc9c.jpg" alt="Anna Goebel
