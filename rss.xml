            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Ron English, 'Marilyn Monroe Mickey 1', 2004, Julien's Auctions: Street Art Now June 2016 | Artsy</h1><p>Ron English has become known for the re-appropriation of pop images like that of Marilyn Monroe and Mickey Mouse, among others, in the ongoing project he calls "POPaganda." Besides being his most well-known print, the aesthetic and palette in this is very representative of the spirit of English's work-cheeky and playful using Mickey's face as nipple covers for the buxom icon.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/fe9d7af78f88def3b7c0e99ec10c3bed/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fd32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net%2F-dJUYNH72efyfz1gMmWLzA%2Fnormalized.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Nick Walker, 'Vandalism', 2014, Julien's Auctions: Street Art Now June 2016 | Artsy</h1><p>Nick Walker, a formative member of the graffiti art movement in 1980s Bristol, England, is best known for merging freehand work with stencilled imagery. As a forerunner of this technique, he believes that the combination allows him to "juxtapose almost photographic imagery with the rawness which evolved from conventional graffiti styles."</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/009f91a2823418056341e154f2d18039/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fd32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net%2F9PQH3_0cTlLsyuKTCEmS6A%2Flarge.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Takashi Murakami, 'And Then (A Deep Ocean Of Ultramarine)', 2013, Julien's Auctions: Street Art Now June 2016 | Artsy</h1><p>The playful Takashi Murakami always delights, with figures inspired by Japanese comics and animation, coquettishly batting eyelashes at their viewers. Murakami's prowess with color is best seen when all versions of this print are shown together-yellows, blues, greens, and candy colored reds enhance and change an image that has become as recognizable as Andy Warhol's soup cans, thanks to the almost cult status of his "Mr. DOB" character.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/39eabe09196e23dd4e9d1fac5febc8c6/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=666&cropwidth=1800&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fd32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net%2FeFujpon9H0eF35PgODxGXQ%2Fnormalized.jpg&x=0&y=0"></article>]]></description>
