            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Donald Sultan, 'Playing Cards: Set of Five', 1989, Heather James Fine Art: Benefit Auction 2016 | Artsy</h1><p>Donald Sultan's large-scale still life paintings are filled with rich iconography-provocative objects, like bulbous fruits, set against a tar-black background. Although primarily classified as a still lifes, Sultan maintains that his works (despite their representational objects-flowers, lemons, eggs, buttons) are first and foremost abstract.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b3bdd1d100a04a5b2eb775d572def666/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fd32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net%2Fow5pbB3XhY7x_eeyep1Z9A%2Fnormalized.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Robert Indiana, 'Decade No. 6', 1980, Heather James Fine Art: Benefit Auction 2016 | Artsy</h1><p>Robert Indiana is a keystone of the 1960s artistic canon. Creating "sculptural poems," Indiana fuses commercial art with Existentialism, and first came to prominence with his iconic sculpture LOVE. His screenprint Decade No. 6 (1980) is one from a series of "decade autoportraits," bright primary colors celebrating deeply resonant events in a tight Pop art composition.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/7632faf7a9df8cb74c288a9bab91dfbb/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fd32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net%2Fo9T6uYqIy8UYRo1BeM8Vjg%2Flarge.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Kelly has included antique botanical drawings, handwritten notes, small sketches, vintage posters, and signs in his work.

"Abstraction is real, probably more real than nature," he once said.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Ron English, 'Marilyn Monroe Mickey 1', 2004, Julien's Auctions: Street Art Now June 2016 | Artsy</h1><p>Ron English has become known for the re-appropriation of pop images like that of Marilyn Monroe and Mickey Mouse, among others, in the ongoing project he calls "POPaganda." Besides being his most well-known print, the aesthetic and palette in this is very representative of the spirit of English's work-cheeky and playful using Mickey's face as nipple covers for the buxom icon.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/fe9d7af78f88def3b7c0e99ec10c3bed/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fd32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net%2F-dJUYNH72efyfz1gMmWLzA%2Fnormalized.jpg"></article>]]></description>

As a forerunner of this technique, he believes that the combination allows him to "juxtapose almost photographic imagery with the rawness which evolved from conventional graffiti styles."</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/009f91a2823418056341e154f2d18039/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fd32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net%2F9PQH3_0cTlLsyuKTCEmS6A%2Flarge.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Takashi Murakami, 'And Then (A Deep Ocean Of Ultramarine)', 2013, Julien's Auctions: Street Art Now June 2016 | Artsy</h1><p>The playful Takashi Murakami always delights, with figures inspired by Japanese comics and animation, coquettishly batting eyelashes at their viewers. Murakami's prowess with color is best seen when all versions of this print are shown together-yellows, blues, greens, and candy colored reds enhance and change an image that has become as recognizable as Andy Warhol's soup cans, thanks to the almost cult status of his "Mr. DOB" character.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/39eabe09196e23dd4e9d1fac5febc8c6/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=666&cropwidth=1800&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fd32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net%2FeFujpon9H0eF35PgODxGXQ%2Fnormalized.jpg&x=0&y=0"></article>]]></description>
