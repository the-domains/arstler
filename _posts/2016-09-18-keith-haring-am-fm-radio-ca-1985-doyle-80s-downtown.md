description: >-
  First created in 1985 for his Pop Shop, Keith Haring's AM/FM Radio is an open
  edition functional art object, like much of the wonderful fare his fantastical
  store was known for. The Dog pull toy, created after his passing in 1992, is
  indicative of how masterfully his imagery and color palette relate to
  children.
