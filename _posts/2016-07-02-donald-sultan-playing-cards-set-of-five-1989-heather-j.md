  Donald Sultan's large-scale still life paintings are filled with rich
  iconography-provocative objects, like bulbous fruits, set against a tar-black
  background. Although primarily classified as a still lifes, Sultan maintains
  that his works (despite their representational objects-flowers, lemons, eggs,
  buttons) are first and foremost abstract.
