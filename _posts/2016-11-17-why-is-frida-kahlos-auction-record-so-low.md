publisher: {}
description: >-
  Over dinner a few days ago, I mentioned to my roommate that Frida Kahlo's
  auction record had recently been broken-her 1939 painting Dos Desnudos en el
  Bosque (La Tierra Misma) sold for $8 million at Christie's New York's spring
  Impressionist and modern evening sale two weeks earlier.
