  Eduardo Santiere creates delicate abstract compositions on paper exclusively
  using graphite, colored pencil, and incisions in the work's surface-a combined
  practice of marking and scratching. He is best known for using a needle to
  lance the paper and create linear patterns from lacerations. As a result, his
  works appear to be both drawings and delicate sculptural reliefs.
