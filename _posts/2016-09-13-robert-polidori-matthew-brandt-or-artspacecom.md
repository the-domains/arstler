  Matthew Brandt's work has an ongoing efforts in exploring historical image
  making techniques. The nature of woodblock printing being a process of leaving
  impressions, led Brandt to think about those who left impressions on him,
  resulting in a series of works representing the fingerprints of influential

  Weber or James Welling.
