  “As the only American artist to be chosen to participate in this important
  exhibition, I will present six large-scale photographic images, ethereal in
  nature, that I believe capture the essence of the theme of this year’s
  Biennale.  The photographing of the great seas has led me to discover the
  richness of this earth’s treasure, and the passion of its ancient and current
  passengers.” _Renay Elle Morris
