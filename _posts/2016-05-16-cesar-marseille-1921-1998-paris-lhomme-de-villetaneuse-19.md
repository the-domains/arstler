  César Marseille 1921 - 1998 Paris L'Homme de Villetaneuse 1959/ Nach 1984
  Bronze with green brown patina. Approx. 103 x 215 x 56 cm. The plinth with
  signature stamp "César", numeration and foundry stamp "fondeur bocquel". Cast
  3/8 (+ 4 E.A.). Founder Fondeur Bocquel, Bréauté. Durand-Ruel 274 (with
  diverging dimensions) In the 1950s the French sculptor begins to produce
  sculptures made of welded metal. L'homme de Villetaneuse illustrates Cesar's
  original working method in which he uses industrial scrap metal as a basis for
  his works. Villetaneuse, the name of a French community north of Paris,
  denotes the place where the basic materials were discovered. Inspired by the
  famous French “BirdMan”, Léo Valentin, César creates his winged figures which
  represent a central theme in the artist's early oeuvre.
