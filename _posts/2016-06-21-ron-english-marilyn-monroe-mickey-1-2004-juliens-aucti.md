  Ron English has become known for the re-appropriation of pop images like that
  of Marilyn Monroe and Mickey Mouse, among others, in the ongoing project he
  calls "POPaganda." Besides being his most well-known print, the aesthetic and
  palette in this is very representative of the spirit of English's work-cheeky
  and playful using Mickey's face as nipple covers for the buxom icon.
