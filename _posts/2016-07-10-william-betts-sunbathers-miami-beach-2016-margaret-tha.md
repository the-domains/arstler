  William Betts uses painting to explore images in the age of surveillance. He
  creates his work like a pointillist painter, carefully applying hundreds of
  acrylic dots to canvas to mimic the pixelated images captured by CCTV, or
  translating a single row of pixels from a digital photo into abstractions with
  an uncannily organic quality.
