Having premiered in 2012 at **XVII Encuentros Abiertos \_ Festival De La Luz**, Buenos Aires, Argentina, this compelling portrait of Valera Cherkashin, created by the artistic team (husband and wife) Natasha and Valera Cherkashin and noted above, is from the original series, entitled: **"Vibrations**,**" **created in 2011\. [www.cherkashinart.com/vibrations][0] After this successful presentation, a selection of images were chosen to be exhibited in 3 prominent Russian museum expositions known at **FACE**, which was on display from 2010 to 2015\.

Now, in 2018, on view from 11 August -- 02 September, and produced by the **Yekaterinburg Museum of Fine Art, **a new version of **FACE**, entitled, **FACE: 2.0** will take place in Yekaterinburg, Russia, located at the crossroads of Europe and Asia. Continuing on with this theme, the Cherkashins, in concert with curator Andrey Martynov, along with the intense interest noted from a wide audience, has led to a revised collection\_ a second incarnation.
