  As it turns out, the man responsible for the first color photograph wasn't
  particularly invested in photography at all. In the mid-1800s, Scottish
  scientist James Clerk Maxwell was far more concerned with his other, manifold
  interests-researching electromagnetism, determining the composition of
  Saturn's rings, and formulating equations that eventually led to Albert
  Einstein's special theory of relativity.
