  Walter De Maria, TRUTH / BEAUTY SERIES (detail), 1993-2016, solid stainless
  steel and granite, fourteen sculptures in seven sets, each sculpture: 7 1/2 ×
  42 1/8 × 42 1/8 inches (19 × 107 × 107 cm) © 2016 Estate of Walter De Maria
  Download Press Release PDF (104 Kb) Opening reception: Thursday, 26th May,
  from 6:00 to 8:00pm I think to be a true minimalist you should almost nearly
  be invisible yourself...expressing yourself in too baroque, romantic a way
  might be...imposing a lot more content on the world than is necessary.
