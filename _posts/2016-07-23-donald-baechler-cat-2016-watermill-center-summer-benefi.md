  Donald Baechler's oeuvre exists between the obvious and the obscure, in which
  symbols of childhood nostalgia are brought to life in strong line and
  silhouette. Considered to be an art world prodigy, Baechler was an active
  member of the East Village art scene in 1980s alongside Jean Michel Basquiat
  and Keith Haring.
