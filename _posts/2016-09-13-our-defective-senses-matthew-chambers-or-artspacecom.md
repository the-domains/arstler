  Matthew Chambers says of this work &ldquo;my ripped works started in 2008 and
  served a place for failed paintings to go. My practice was (and still is)
  studio oriented and painting-centric. Ripping and arranging the strips into
  new paintings allowed my practice to remain waste-free and lossless, the work
  never stopped and the images never ceased moving.
