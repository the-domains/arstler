  Nick Walker, a formative member of the graffiti art movement in 1980s Bristol,
  England, is best known for merging freehand work with stencilled imagery. As a
  forerunner of this technique, he believes that the combination allows him to
  "juxtapose almost photographic imagery with the rawness which evolved from
  conventional graffiti styles."
