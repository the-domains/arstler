# Reduction Woodblock Print

For a reduction woodblock print the designs for each color are carved onto the same block. The artist starts by carving the design of the lightest color on a wooden block. Then all paper impressions are pulled in the desired number of the edition planned. The second layer for the second color is carved and the impressions are pulled. And so on - until the desired image is complete.

At the end the original block has destroyed itself by the process. The printing of more copies than originally planned is impossible.

The technique of a reduction woodblock print requires careful planning of the whole process by the artist and excellent craftsmanship in carving and printing. Due to the complexity the number of colors are limited for a reduction woodblock print.

The artist seldom uses more than 5 different colors. For more intricate color designs, artists may use more than one block. As long as more than one color are pulled from one block and as long as the process cannot be repeated due to the natural destruction of the block, one can regard it as a reduction woodblock print.
