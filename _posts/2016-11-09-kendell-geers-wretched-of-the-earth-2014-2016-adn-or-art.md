  Incorporating language, ready-mades, broken glass, film, performance, and
  other elements, Kendell Geers creates work that disrupts social norms and
  codes. Employing a wide range of references-from art history to pornography,
  iconography to kitsch-Geers questions the value of aesthetics and thumbs his
  nose at the concept of originality.
