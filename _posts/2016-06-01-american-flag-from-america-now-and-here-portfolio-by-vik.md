  Vik Muniz has held a lifelong fascination with iconic denotation,
  ephemerality, and photographic representation. Here, he presents a c-print of
  a United States flag composed of many multicolored plants. This is his
  contribution to the "America: Now and Here" portfolio, a set of thirteen
  prints by prominent artists made to accompany Eric Fischl's 2011 traveling
  exhibition meant to stir conversations about national identity and the arts.
