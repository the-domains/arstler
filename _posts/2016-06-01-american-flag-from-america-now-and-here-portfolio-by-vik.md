description: "Vik Muniz has held a lifelong fascination with iconic denotation, ephemerality, and photographic representation. Here, he presents a c-print of a United States flag composed of many multicolored plants. This is his contribution to the \"America: Now and Here\" portfolio, a set of thirteen prints by prominent artists made to accompany Eric Fischl's 2011 traveling exhibition meant to stir conversations about national identity and the arts."
