  Since Frank Stella exhibited the dour simplicity of his Black Paintings at The
  Museum of Modern Art in 1959-1960, he has shaped and challenged trends in art,
  including Abstract Expressionism, Minimalist, and post-Minimalism. His complex
  use of structure, color, and shape has enlivened his work throughout his
  career, with sometimes subtle and great changes.
