  American artist Sol LeWitt (1928-2007) is renowned as a founding member of
  both the Minimalist and Conceptual Art movements. Working in New York in the
  1960s, LeWitt aimed to reduce art to the most basic shapes, colors, and lines.
  The execution of the work was much less important to LeWitt than the original
  concept.
