  Appearing in the 2011 Maccarone Gallery exhibition "After Shelley Duvall '72
  (Frogs on the Highline)," curated by Bjarne Melgaard, this untitled work by
  Martin Wong is indicative of much of his painting. At first confrontational
  and graphic, the image rests upon Martin's representative brick work, evoking
  the Lower East Side buildings where he lived and worked.
