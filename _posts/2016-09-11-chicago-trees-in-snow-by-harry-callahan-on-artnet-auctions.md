description: >-
  Chicago (Trees in Snow) is one of Harry Callahan's most iconic works,
  depicting stark, black trees against a winter landscape along Chicago's Lake
  Shore Drive. Hand printed by Callahan, this photograph is an especially
  high-quality, rare print. It is incredibly detailed, and elements such as the
  grass peeking through the snow and the lake in the distance are visible in
  this print.
