  From a kiln in the woods of upstate New York, Tim Rowan sculpts geode-like
  ceramic vessels that are both dense and curvilinear. His apprenticeship to
  Japanese artist Ryuichi Kazurezaki instilled a deep respect for traditional
  Japanese design, evident in the firing and flame markings of his work.
