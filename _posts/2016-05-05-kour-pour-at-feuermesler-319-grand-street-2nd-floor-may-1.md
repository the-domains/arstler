  courtesy of the artist and Feuer/Mesler, New York. The L.A.-based British
  artist of Iranian descent presents his new “Tectonic” paintings—works filled
  with flat, interlocking planes of color, which are inspired by the
  19th-century European fascination with Japanese art. He creates these works
  using the traditional Japanese ukiyo-e printing process, and adopts their
  forms from earthquake and volcano maps that were generated by the Japanese
  Geological Survey. Also on view are new paper works inspired by Japanese
  papermaking, which he creates by throwing ink-dyed newspaper pulp at canvases.
