Images courtesy of the artist and Feuer/Mesler, New York. The L.A.-based British artist of Iranian descent presents his new “Tectonic” paintings—works filled with flat, interlocking planes of color, which are inspired by the 19th-century European fascination with Japanese art. He creates these works using the traditional Japanese ukiyo-e printing process, and adopts their forms from earthquake and volcano maps that were generated by the Japanese Geological Survey. Also on view are new paper works inspired by Japanese papermaking, which he creates by throwing ink-dyed newspaper pulp at canvases.'
