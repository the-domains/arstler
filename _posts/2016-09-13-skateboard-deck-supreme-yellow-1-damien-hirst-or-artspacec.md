  This limited edition skateboard deck by Damien Hirst incorporates several
  recognizable motifs from the artist&rsquo;s oeuvre including a bejeweled
  skull, butterfly and biohazard logo. Skulls especially are a common theme in
  Hirst&rsquo;s work, standing amidst the genres of art, history, and religion
  as a conspicuous totem of death.
