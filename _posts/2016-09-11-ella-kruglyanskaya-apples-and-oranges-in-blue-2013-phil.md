  Ella Kruglyanskaya paints large-scale, cartoonish vignettes featuring
  exuberant, full-figured women and their fashion accessories. Characterized by
  splashy colors and patterns, her paintings depict women in revealing clothes,
  engaged in leisure activities or absurdist scenarios, such as (2010), in which
  a woman in high heels riding a small horse is attacked by a crocodile.
