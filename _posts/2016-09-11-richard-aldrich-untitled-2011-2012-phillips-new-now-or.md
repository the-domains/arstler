  In his installations, paintings, and the narratives he writes to accompany his
  works, Richard Aldrich engages in a dialogic relationship with art history and
  artmaking. Many of Aldrich's vigorously painted canvases pay homage to their
  Abstract Expressionist antecedents, while others, such as the mixed-media
  Future Painting from Machine (orange and green) , 2005, exhibit a unique
  signature style.
