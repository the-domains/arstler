  The present woodcut is from the very small edition of 25, making it highly
  sought-after. Yoshitomo Nara's Mushroom House portrays a childlike scene with
  a sweet and cartoonish central figure. The layers of the roof of the home are
  interrupted by what appears to be a young child's head curiously sandwiched
  between the thatched, brightly colored mushroom-like layers.
