  Neo-expressionist painter Eric Fischl achieved recognition in the 1980s for
  his figurative paintings exploring suburban adolescent sexuality, as in
  Sleepwalker (1979), which depicts a boy hunched over in a plastic pool,
  masturbating. His work commonly exposes the dark, disturbing undercurrents of
  American life; his unconventional 9/11 memorial sculpture, Tumbling Woman
  (2001), was removed from public view amid controversy.
