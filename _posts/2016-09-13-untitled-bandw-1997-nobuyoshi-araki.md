description: >-
  Untitled (1997)is from Araki's exceptionalKinbakuseries, illustrating the
  highly skilled art of erotic restraint, which first came to notice in Japan in
  the late Edo period and flourished into a recognised art form in the early
  twentieth century. Precisely executed, the intricate knots and specific rope
  patterns on the model's body are beautifully enhanced by the monochromatic
  elegance of Araki's composition.
