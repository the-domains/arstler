  The playful Takashi Murakami always delights, with figures inspired by
  Japanese comics and animation, coquettishly batting eyelashes at their
  viewers. Murakami's prowess with color is best seen when all versions of this
  print are shown together-yellows, blues, greens, and candy colored reds
  enhance and change an image that has become as recognizable as Andy Warhol's
  soup cans, thanks to the almost cult status of his "Mr. DOB" character.
