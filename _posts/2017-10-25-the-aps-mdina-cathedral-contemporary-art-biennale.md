The APS Mdina Cathedral Contemporary Art Biennale, open from 13th November of this year until 7th January 2018, is once again at the forefront of discussing the dialogue between classical and contemporary art. Held within the medieval-cum-baroque precincts of Malta's oldest capital city, this year's edition will reinterpret last edition's success by focusing solely on one single space -- the Cathedral Museum and its magnificent baroque halls. 

The museum, famed for housing artworks, architectural fragments and curios, is a space that reflects the Maltese identity as well, and thus contemplates this year's theme: _The Mediterranean: A Sea of Conflicting Spiritualties_, succinctly. Different to the previous 2015 edition is the decision to use one sole space: the Cathedral Museum. In this way, the exploration of the past and the present, the insular and the cosmopolitan, as well as the negative and the positive can be performed within an enclosed space, familiar, adored and enchanted by centuries of history. The theme, as stated above, will once again incorporate the ideals of the spirit, the cerebral and the ephemeral, a stark contrast to the robust nature of Mdina's walls. Paradoxically, in a world full of conflict and division, divergence unites us all.

While the Cathedral Museum is a repository for paintings, sculptures, drawings and artefacts of the decorative arts, it also functions as a part of the Cathedral's compound. The extant collection derives from the 1897 collection housed within adjacent halls to the Cathedral before it was moved to the seminary in 1969, where the collection still remains to this date. The dual relationship of the museum as an art space as well as a functioning building comes to the fore within the layout. While dormitories and such do not exist any more, an example of its past function as a prelate seminary is the chapel dedicated to the Annunciation located on the first floor. 

The Mdina Biennale started as an exhibition of solely Catholic and religious art. The immensity of the contemporary world was somewhat ignored in favour for the personalised taste of a local few, in an attempt to always safeguard the status quo. This 2015-16 exhibition helped awaken the need for a new contemporary space to welcome both local and international artists. The past has seen great strides in the rejoicement of contemporary art, with several spaces or exhibitions being set up, and with Malta's recent entry in the Venice Biennale after a long hiatus. Nonetheless, it is this aspect of one-offs that brings peril to the contemporary scene in Malta. The need for continuity, remembrance and vitalisation is at the core of the Mdina Biennale.

Within the remits of the Mdina Biennale, this space was transformed from just being a sphere of sanctimonious sentiment to encompassing the spirit of the new age, through the exhibition of local and foreign contemporary artists. Artists from Malta, Italy, UK, USA, Germany, France, Jordan, Israel, Poland, Lithuania, Georgia, Latvia, Greece, Australia, Portugal, Serbia, Russia, Austria and Lebanon will be participating.

Each artist has been assigned a particular space within the museum and will be developing projects that respond to its permanent collection and this year's subject. Once again, an exhibit dedicated to Maltese modern artists will hang alongside medieval, baroque and contemporary artworks, bridging different eras and art historical periods by focusing on the overlapping nature of art across time. Frank Portelli and Esprit Barthet are the chosen artists of this year's exhibition. As a prelude to the main event, an exhibition of nude figure drawings by the Maltese twentieth-century artist and designer Giuseppe Galea was held from 7th-31st October.  
The APS Mdina Cathedral Contemporary Art Biennale is once again under the artistic direction of Dr Giuseppe Schembri Bonaci with a curatorial team led by Nikki Petroni. APS Bank is the main partner. The exhibition endeavours to bring out the past with the marriage of the present and future. It is this duality, of both idea and space, which allows the APS Mdina Biennale to take ownership of a new style of curatorship, dialogue and commemoration.
