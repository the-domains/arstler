  Adam Frezza (b. 1977) and Terri Chiao (b. 1981) are based in Bushwick,
  Brooklyn. The collaborative duo's work explores everyday life and domestic
  play, and they create crafted, joyful sculptures, installations, collages and
  paintings. Inspired by unusual and unique surfaces, they embrace vibrant color
  palettes, surreal elements, and their projects can be characterized as
  existing at the "intersection of imagination and the natural world."
