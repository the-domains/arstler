**In the afterglow of the visual conversation "The Mediterranean: A Sea of Conflicting Spiritualities"\_ **the 2017-18 APS _Mdina_ Cathedral Contemporary Art _Biennale_ held in the country of Malta, I am delighted to showcase a selection of interpretive works authored by an international network of artists and curated by a talented team, guided by artistic director Dr.Giuseppe Schembri-Bonaci and Nikki Petroni. It was a global triumph\_ a narrative explored with diverse translations, creating a visual display in various mediums\_ painting, sculpture, photography, and multimedia platforms\_ artistic voices heard through the most personal of presentations.

In this 2nd edition, at the impressive the Mdina Cathedral Museum, over 30 works were presented throughout the treasury. The interplay of the works, installed on different landings, led the viewer on a spiritual traverse\_ and to the cavernous underground passageway leveled below\_ an ethereal space in itself.

With an invitation to participate, I delight in the bonds of friendship that were made through this distinctive and highly creative opportunity. Thus, I am proud to share this journey, and thank all the wonderful artists, academics, clergy and business entities, as well as visitors that have made this not only an exhibition, but a forum for its timely theme of conflicting spiritualities, an important one.

**The Artists\_ The Works**

**Savina Capecci** (in art Savina Kapecci)\_ lives in Pordenone Italy, and studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Venice where she received her B.A. in Painting in 2014 and her Master Degree in 2016 with full marks. She worked as assistant to the professors in the classes of painting at the Free Academy of Fine Arts in Klagenfurt, Austria as well as participating in selected exhibitions.

Capecci has received several art awards with her work included in a variety of publications.

* Premio Arte Cairo Mondadori Finalists exhibition, Palazzo Reale and Palazzo della Permanente, Milan
* Transgenic Attack, Atelier der Stadt Klagenfurt, Austria solo exhibition
* BV Sommerausstellung, BV Galerie, Klagenfurt, Austria
* Memento Andy, Atelier 3+10, Venice
* Fuori Uso, Avviso di garanzia, Ex Tribunal, Pescara
* Premio Lilian Caraian, Museum of Modern Art Revoltella, Trieste
* Incident III -- Accident Czestochowa Museum, Poland

The works presented at the Mdina Biennale are titled "The PromiSSed land". The painted images depict the human aspect of the current immigration crisis happening in the Mediterranean sea, and are expressive of the essence of the concept of "waiting" in all its forms and feelings that arise while sitting in a boat. The Promised land inevitably becomes a "pro-missed" land.

**James Alec Hardy\_ **born -- 1979 in Colchester, England. The essence of James Alec Hardy's practice is a process concerned with the impact of technologies on our experience of life. Since 2002, he has focused on analogue video systems, manifesting ideas through performance, sculpture, installation and print. By using obsolete devices from a former analogue age to reproduce digital functions, Hardy's practice is challenging and engaging\_ranging from building sculptural totems of video monitors, to 3 month long shamanic residencies in fields with I-Cabin, to 3 day long noise and feedback performances at The Tate Modern.

"With the truth being understood as subjective, the video sculptures I create do not limit freedom of thought, but stimulate choice. I aim to avoid manipulating the viewer by presenting 'video as truth', my work allows the video to function ultimately as the meditative stage for the mind, which unravels its own truth."

**Robert Stokowy\_ **is a sound artist, composer and artistic researcher from Cologne, Germany. His work entails experimental compositions, text based interventions, audiovisual performances and installations. All projects are framed by an overarching artistic research process, focussing on topics of instability, sensory balance, as well as qualitative characteristics and potentiality of sound and place. Stokowy's site-specific Sound Installations are based on phenomenological practices and consist of small sounds which hold very haptic and organic qualities. With his works the artist wants to explore the potentiality of his sonic surroundings and give recipients access to experience new perspectives on their environment.

Since Stokowy's work is first and foremost based on sound, a recording of the installation is available on his website.

**Anthony Catania\_** is a visual artist specializing in myths and fables. Often on the threshold of grotesque figurative painting, his style attempts to capture subversively idiosyncratic portraits of legendary beings embedded in bizarrely anachronistic settings. His personal exhibitions; _Selve Oscure_, _The Cave of Centaurs_, _The Piper's Requiem_, _Spectre-Bark_ and _Last Light_, were held at the Malta Museum of Fine Arts, the Malta Maritime Museum and Heritage Malta. Catania is a PhD candidate at the University of Malta, where he also received his MFA in Digital Arts with a distinction. Catania also worked as a concept designer for indie games_, _poster designer for theatre productions and illustrator of academic book covers. He currently lectures on illustration, primitivism and sequential art at the University of Malta.

_Wilting Annunciation_ depicts the typical scene where the angel Gabriel announces the birth of Christ and incarnation of God. The announcement is that of Christ's passion endured for humanity's redemption from the agony in the garden of Gethsemane until His death on Calvary. It also depicts the passion of a Mater Dolorosa who will cradle the corpse of her son through fertile/dead sunflower seeds. Death and life are depicted in an oxymoronic manner.

**Gor Chahal\_ **was born in Moscow in 1961 and is one of the most highly accomplished contemporary artists. His creative method synthesizes a scholastic approach with the elements of a ritual. Chahal is of a type rarely found in the Russian artistic community: a «universal master», with a diploma in science and applied mathematics, from the Moscow Engineering and Physics Institute, a contributor to numerous creative experiments undertaken in cooperation with groups of poets, musicians, and artists of Soviet-era Underground. But while the style of Chahal's creations lie within the parameters of Actual Art, yet in substance they are at the other end of the spectrum. His themes often encompass faith and show a deep awareness that true art simply cannot exist without connection to tradition of the sacred, Christianity in this case.

**Michael von Cube\_ **Born -- 1952, Cube lives and works in Munich, Lower-Bavaria and Malta.

The reality of the political situation in the Mediterranean surpasses the image of brutality by far, and so the picture remains what it should be and is -- a helpless plea: art.

When Johann Wolfgang von Goethe set off on his travels to Italy, the Age of Enlightenment was of great significance in Europe. The education system and lifestyle of the ancient world was seen as the model for a civil society. Committed to ‚Goodness, Truth and Beauty' (Winckelmann), artists and romantics from all walks of like were drawn to the cradle of European culture: The Mediterranean. The painter Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein created the famous portrait of the German writer entitled „Goethe in the Roman Campagna".

'Europium' takes an ironic look at this idealistic approach or what is indeed left of it today: The princess of peace and her system of values surrounded by lemons symbolising a united Europe. It refers to the vision of the writer, Goethe, just like peace-game' does to the abolition of violence and war.

**Ana Caterina Pereira\_** believes that materials determine the way humanity operates and her work is centred on their composition and behaviour. She is also interested on the impact their existence have in our society, in particular architecture, politics and gender roles. Steel is Pereira's material of choice -- its chemical properties and reactions determine the subject of the work. She combines this metal with other materials in order to activate or counteract their intrinsic properties.

Pereira completed her Masters at Chelsea College of Arts in 2012, being awarded with Clifford Chance Prize the following year. In 2014, Pereira received the Royal British Society of Sculptors Bursary. The work shown at Mdina Biennal in 2015 represents the beginning of a new body of work that explored the rigidity that characterises steel.

Pereira's work was selected for several listings and shown in a variety of occasions, including the Aesthetic Art Prize (2014), Signature Art Prize (2015), Anthology (2016) and First@108 (2017). This last experience opened her the desire to work outdoors, which was realised with "Now outside the doors of strange houses". Based on the study of steel's atomic structure, this sculpture is on show at Broomhill Sculpture Park till May 2018\.

**Lena Lapschina\_ **graduated from State Stroganow University of Fine and Applied Arts in Moscow. She lives and works in Vienna and Lower Austria. Lapschina has won the Austrian State Grant for Video and Media Art and was awarded several prestigious residencies, including the Djerassi Residence Artists Program (Woodside, California), KuS (Heerlen, Netherlands), ORTung (Strobl, Austria), and Nordens Hus (Reykjavík, Iceland).

In Lapschina's three-channel video installation "Runtime", a character is moving with great haste. It does so for minutes, for hours, for days. There's no aim in sight, not even a fata morgana. Synchronously a timepiece slowly but surely is wandering across the scene. While at first glance the character seems to be driven by customary stress and inner conflicts, it turns out that the piece is tackling the more sensitive issues of modern societies. If the attire of the character is any indication, it's about civilization at large, which in the eyes of many people is at stake these days. Maybe the artist wants to remind us of two facts: 1\. People on this planet have been running along the surface of the earth's crust in search for paradise for ages. 2\. It's the Mediterranean, which once again is the arena of the world's greatest conflicts.

Nicola Reed uses the medium of photography, film and printmaking in her work. For many years, and as a mother of six children, her work was focused on, and explored Mother Daughter Dynamics, using herself and her three daughters as the subjects for a body of work. As a supporter of the charity EthiopiAid, and visiting and photographing the people of Ethiopia since the late 1980s, Reed produced a series of photographic portraits focused on the dissipating tribes and cultures in Ethiopia with the intention to celebrate the individuality, unique style and personality that is so pertinent to the people of the Omo Valley in Southern Ethiopia. Her current project is inspired by her passion for bee-keeping and protecting bees from the current and serious threat to their existence. More examples of Nicola's work can be found on her website.
