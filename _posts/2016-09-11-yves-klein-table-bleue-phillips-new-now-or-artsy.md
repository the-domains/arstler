  Yves Klein is best known for his trademark ultramarine pigment, which he
  patented as International Klein Blue in 1961. "Blue...is beyond dimensions,
  whereas the other colors are not," he said. "All colors arouse specific ideas,
  while blue suggests at most the sea and the sky; and they, after all, are in
  actual, visible nature what is most abstract."
