  Munkácsy was born as Michael Leo Lieb (Lieb Mihály Leó) to Mihály Lieb, an
  bureaucrat of Bavarian origin, and Cecília Reök, in Munkács, Hungary, Austrian
  Empire, the town from which he later adopted his pseudonym. After being
  apprenticed to itinerant painter Elek Szamossy, Munkácsy went to Pest, the
  largest city in Hungary (now part of Budapest), where he sought the patronage
  of established artists.
