  During her lifetime, Ruth Bernhard shot almost exclusively in black-and-white,
  focusing on the sensuality of the human body, resulting in images that are
  charged with erotic power. In her silver gelatin print, Mother & Child, Joane
  (1963), a mother clutches her infant, lovingly cradling it to her.
