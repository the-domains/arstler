# Robert Motherwell

(January 24, 1915 -- July 16, 1991)

<article style=""><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/2b2431f8e7ba7b0/6becf240a6ddb0bfda3a509fde338c62/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.formidablemag.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2014%2F06%2F20140628-172014-62414460-jpg.jpg" /><p>Robert Motherwell, a major figure of the Abstract Expressionist generation, encompassed both the expressive brushwork of action painting and the breadth of scale and saturated hues of color field painting. He was a member of the New York School, a term he coined, which also included Philip Guston, Willem de Kooning, Jackson Pollock, and Mark Rothko.</p></article>

**Robert Motherwell** was an American painter, printmaker, and editor. He was one of the youngest of the New York School (a phrase he coined), which also included Philip Guston, Willem de Kooning, Jackson Pollock, and Mark Rothko.

During the late 1940s and 1950s Motherwell spent much of his time lecturing and teaching; he taught at Black Mountain College, NC, in 1950, and from 1951 to 1959 at Hunter College, New York. He also worked on three influential editorial projects: the Documents of Modern Art series, which he initiated in 1944 and which included his most important literary contribution to the history of modern art, the Dada Painters and Poets: An Anthology (New York, 1951); Possibilities magazine, from 1947; and Modern Artists in America (New York, 1951), which he co-authored with [Ad Reinhardt][0].

In 1940, Motherwell moved to New York to study at [Columbia University][1], where he was encouraged by [Meyer Schapiro][2] to devote himself to painting rather than scholarship. Shapiro introduced the young artist to a group of exiled Parisian Surrealists ([Max Ernst][3], [Duchamp][4], [Masson][5]) and arranged for Motherwell to study with [Kurt Seligmann][6]. The time that Motherwell spent with the Surrealists proved to be influential to his artistic process. After a 1941 voyage with [Roberto Matta][7] to Mexico---on a boat where he met Maria, an actress and his future wife---Motherwell decided to make painting his primary vocation. The sketches Motherwell made in Mexico later evolved into his first important paintings, such as _Little Spanish Prison_ (1941), and _Pancho Villa, Dead and Alive_ (1943), both in the [MoMA][8] collection).

It was Matta who introduced Motherwell to the concept of "automatic" drawings. The Surrealists often deployed the process of automatism, or abstract "automatic" doodling to tap into their unconscious. This concept had a lasting effect on Motherwell, but it was conceptually changed, when Motherwell met [Wolfgang Paalen][9] in Mexico and decided to prolong his stay and to spend several months in his studio. Motherwell´s famous _Mexican Sketchbook_ visually reflect this conceptual change: while the first drawings are somehow analyzing copies of examples by Matta and Tanguy, the drawings, done in Paalen´s atelier or during his studies with Paalen show more plane graphic cadences, swelling ink-spots as a pictorial access to yet unseen or possible figurations, remembering the fumage-spots which also relinquished traditional aspects of perspective and suggested swelling ephemeral shapes. It was also Paalen who introduced Motherwell to André Breton with an introduction letter. The consequences and influences on various levels and on other American painters such as [Jackson Pollock][10], [Lee Krasner][11] and [William Baziotes][12], whom Motherwell befriended in New York after a trip to Mexico, are not finally explored. In 1991, shortly before he died, Motherwell remembered a "conspiracy of silence" regarding Paalen´s innovative role in the genesis of Abstract Expressionism.

Upon return from Mexico Motherwell spent time developing his creative principle based on automatism: "what I realized was that Americans potentially could paint like angels but that there was no creative principle around, so that everybody who liked modern art was copying it. [Gorky][13] was copying [Picasso][14]. Pollock was copying Picasso. [De Kooning][15] was copying Picasso. I mean I say this unqualifiedly. I was painting French intimate pictures or whatever. And all we needed was a creative principle, I mean something that would mobilize this capacity to paint in a creative way, and that's what Europe had that we hadn't had; we had always followed in their wake. And I thought of all the possibilities of free association---because I also had a psychoanalytic background and I understood the implications---might be the best chance to really make something entirely new which everybody agreed was the thing to do."

Thus, in the early 1940s, Robert Motherwell played a significant role in laying the foundations for the new movement of Abstract Expressionism (or the New York School): "Matta wanted to start a revolution, a movement, within Surrealism. He asked me to find some other American artists that would help start a new movement. It was then that Baziotes and I went to see Pollock and de Kooning and Hofmann and Kamrowski and Busa and several other people. And if we could come with something. Peggy Guggenheim who liked us said that she would put on a show of this new business. And so I went around explaining the theory of automatism to everybody because the only way that you could have a movement was that it had some common principle. It sort of all began that way."

**Action painting**, sometimes called "**gestural abstraction**", is a style of painting in which paint is spontaneously dribbled, splashed or smeared onto the canvas, rather than being carefully applied. The resulting work often emphasizes the physical act of painting itself as an essential aspect of the finished work or concern of its artist. The preceding art of Kandinsky and Mondrian had freed itself from the portrayal of objects and instead tried to evoke, address and delineate, through the aesthetic sense, emotions and feelings within the viewer. _Action painting_ took this a step further, using both Jung and Freud's ideas of the subconscious as its underlying foundations. The paintings of the Action painters were not meant to portray objects per se or even specific emotions. Instead they were meant to touch the observer deep in the subconscious mind, evoking a sense of the primeval and tapping the collective sense of an archetypal visual language. This was done by the artist painting "unconsciously," and spontaneously, creating a powerful arena of raw emotion and action, in the moment. Action painting was clearly influenced by the surrealist emphasis on automatism which (also) influenced by psychoanalysis claimed a more direct access to the subconscious mind. Important exponents of this concept of art making were the painters Joan Miró and André Masson. However the action painters took everything the surrealists had done a step further.

It is essential for the understanding of action painting to place it in historical context. A product of the post-World War II artistic resurgence of expressionism in America and more specifically New York City, action painting developed in an era where quantum mechanics and psychoanalysis were beginning to flourish and were changing people's perception of the physical and psychological world; and civilization's understanding of the world through heightened self-consciousness and awareness.
