  Influenced by his mentor Clyfford Still&rsquo;s visionary aspirations, Ernest
  Briggs developed the rugged California aesthetic into sensual, refined, and
  inviting explosions of paint. &ldquo;The discipline to free one&rsquo;s image
  from the conventional aspects without surrendering the affirmative drama of
  human insight to the sterility of decoration or simple design problems has
  been, and I believe will be, my continuing direction,&rdquo; explained Briggs
  in 1956.
