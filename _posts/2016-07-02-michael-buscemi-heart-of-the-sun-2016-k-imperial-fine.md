  Michael Buscemi creates baroque imagery with minimal means in his complex
  monochromatic reliefs. "The white collages came to me in a quest to eliminate
  all existing media, leaving only light, shape, and shadow," he says. "I love
  to make them undulate and allow the forms to remain organic yet suggestive."
