Kendell Geers, 'Wretched of the Earth 48', 2014-2016, ADN

<article style=""><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/058571c7abdada018fcf3444016faff17b6dcfa6.jpg" /><p>Incorporating language, ready-mades, broken glass, film, performance, and other elements, Kendell Geers creates work that disrupts social norms and codes.
