Ca fiu al unui proeminent diplomat român, Andrei Cădere a suferit în primele decenii comuniste o existență marginală, sub supravegherea Securității. A emigrat în Franța în 1967 și, după mai mulți ani de căutări, a devenit o figură memorabilă a scenei culturale pariziene și nu numai.</p></article>

The nude is an age-old subject of art. Most crucially for me, the nude has frequently served as a vehicle for expressing love, desire, and beauty, as well as erotic frenzy, terror and pain.</p></article>

The group show is also a statement by Raluca Soaita and Andrei Breahna.</p></article>

The gallery is reminiscent of the old communist era, and the show is in plain sight, as one can watch through the windows of the gallery, and even though you have to enter strangely to the back door, once you are inside you get to warm up in the presence of the artworks.</p></article>

The artist starts by carving the design of the lightest color on a wooden block. Then all paper impressions are pulled in the desired number of the edition planned.</p></article>

The history is of special interest, unusual yet evolutionary. In 1998 Twombly was working on three related but at the time independent canvases on three adjacent walls of his Gaeta studio.</p></article>

His engagement with German national identity at a time when many artists were shying away from so difficult a subject was an extraordinary act of self-assertion. Much of his best work appears hideous, unsettling, and in some cases even crude.</p></article>
