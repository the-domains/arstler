description: >-
  A major figure of the postwar German avant-garde, Joseph Beuys viewed art as a
  vehicle for social change. His performance art "actions" were shamanistic
  experiences incorporating ritualized movement and sound, as well as
  non-traditional and even repulsive materials such as fat, felt, honey, blood,
  and dead animals.
