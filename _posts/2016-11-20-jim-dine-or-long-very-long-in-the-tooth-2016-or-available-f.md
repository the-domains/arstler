  Although often associated with both Pop Art and Abstract Expressionism, Jim
  Dine did not identify with a specific movement, producing a vast oeuvre of
  paintings, drawings, works on paper, sculpture, poetry, and performances.
  Emerging as a pioneer (together with Allan Kaprow, Claes Oldenburg, and Robert
  Whitman) of New York’s Happenings of the 1960s, Dine would carry the
  spontaneous energy of this movement throughout his style, which emphasized the
  exploration of everyday life. Personally significant objects were Dine’s
  primary motifs, as in his iconic series of hearts and robes. He championed a
  return to figuration after a period of more concept-dominated works, and is
  considered an important figure in Neo-Dada and a forerunner of
  Neo-Expressionism. “The figure is still the only thing I have faith in in
  terms of how much emotion it’s charged with and how much subject matter is
  there,” he once said.
