  Petra Cortright uses a range of mediums, both digital and analog, to explore
  the aesthetics and performative cultures of online consumption. She is
  particularly interested in video-sharing sites like Youtube: in (2007), for
  example, Cortright recorded herself on a webcam passively scrolling through
  different effects on the recording device, while a repetitive trance beat
  played in the background.
