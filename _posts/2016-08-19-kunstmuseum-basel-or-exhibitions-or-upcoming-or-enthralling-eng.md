  The Kunstmuseum Basel's Kupferstichkabinett owns an exceptionally rich
  assortment of engravings by Goltzius; the exhibition will be the first to
  present the full breadth of our holdings. The works have been among the
  museum's treasures for a long time, and some can be traced to the generous
  donation made by the Basel landscape painter and collector Samuel Birmann
  (1793-1847).
