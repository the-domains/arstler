Timothy Sullivan is raising funds for The Mysterious Package Company Presents: Filigree in Shadow on Kickstarter! Filigree in Shadow is a Victorian thriller, delivered to your doorstep by mail.

As the Curator at The Mysterious Package Company I have told many stories, but today I don't want to tell you a story. Rather, I want you to experience one! It is a story about a house and its many guises: a family residence, a clinic, an illusionist's abode, and a club of ill repute. This house harbours a type of madness, a mystery that taints the lives of all of its inhabitants. It began with secrets and shame, but where will it end?

Filigree in Shadow is currently ready to go into production; the tale has been written and all of the artifacts and other physical items have been designed and prototyped. This is where we need your help to allow us to produce this remarkable tale in sufficient quantity to keep it cost effective. We are so enthralled with this story that we want as many people as possible to experience it.
