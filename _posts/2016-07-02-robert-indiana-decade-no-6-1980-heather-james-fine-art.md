  Robert Indiana is a keystone of the 1960s artistic canon. Creating "sculptural
  poems," Indiana fuses commercial art with Existentialism, and first came to
  prominence with his iconic sculpture LOVE. His screenprint Decade No. 6 (1980)
  is one from a series of "decade autoportraits," bright primary colors
  celebrating deeply resonant events in a tight Pop art composition.
