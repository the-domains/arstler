description: >-
  Acknowledging the influence of Abstract Expressionism, Arte Povera, and Henri
  Matisse, Matt Connors also draws from language, music, and design to create
  paintings that seem simultaneously familiar and new. Foil (2011) for instance,
  evokes the crescent shapes and primary colors of Joan Miró, but with a
  confounding haziness described by one critic in Artforum as "somewhere between
  a bumpy sfumato and the signature spray of graffiti."
