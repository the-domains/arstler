Wright's June Design auction features more than 300 lots --- from Bauhaus classics to extraordinary items from the California Craft movement --- by some of the most influential and notable designers of the 20th century. Designs by George Nakashima, Charlotte Perriand, Gio Ponti and Finn Juhl will be sold alongside architectural elements by Dankmar Adler and Louis Sullivan and much more. Standing out among the offerings are two collections from celebrated and published interiors with works from the Morton D. May House in Ladue, Missouri, a total work of art by the celebrated architect Samuel Marx, and works from the Mr. and Mrs Edward Goodrich Residence in Los Angeles, California designed by Paul Frankl.
