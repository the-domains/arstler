# Joseph Beuys

**Joseph Beuys** (12 May 1921 -- 23 January 1986) was a German Fluxus, [happening][0], and [performance artist][1] as well as a sculptor, [installation artist][2], graphic artist, [art theorist][3], and [pedagogue][4].

His extensive work is grounded in concepts of [humanism][5], [social philosophy][6] and [anthroposophy][7]; it culminates in his "extended definition of art" and the idea of [social sculpture][8] as a [gesamtkunstwerk][9], for which he claimed a creative, participatory role in shaping [society][10] and [politics][11]. His career was characterized by passionate and only rarely acrimonious open public debates on a very wide range of subjects including political, environmental, social and long term cultural trends. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential artists of the second half of the 20th century
