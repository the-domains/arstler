  Jon Pilkington at 247365 57 STANTON STREET, APRIL 22–MAY 22 Installation view
  of Jon Pilkington at 247365, 2016. Photo courtesy of 247365. Stirring together
  painting’s basic elements of line, form, and color, the London-based
  Pilkington creates works that toe the line between abstraction and figuration.
  In some pieces, beneath whirls of energetic brushstrokes, a viewer might find
  hints of a still life—a plate, a plant, a Matisse-like fishbowl. Other
  canvases are gridded off into sections of pattern and washes of color.
