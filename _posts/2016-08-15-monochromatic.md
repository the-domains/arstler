  Asya Geisberg Gallery is pleased to present "Monochromatic", an exhibition of
  works that are primarily black or white, and investigates how artists exploit
  the opportunities presented by an achromatic position. Displayed on
  alternating black or white walls, the artworks rely on texture, shape,
  positive and negative, surface, contrast, and content, all allowed to claim
  primacy when color is extracted.
