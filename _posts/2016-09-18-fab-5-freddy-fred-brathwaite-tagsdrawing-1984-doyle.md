  Fab 5 Freddy (Fred Brathwaite), 'Tags/Drawing', 1984, Doyle: '80s Downtown
  Art 
publisher: {}
description: >-
  Dating from 1984, Tags/Drawing is emblematic not only of Fab 5 Freddy's shift
  from subway to gallery, but for all of '80s graffiti. Brathwaite was one of
  only a few who were able to transition away from illegal street art,
  recontextualizing the rawness of graffiti into a conventional fine art gallery
  setting.
