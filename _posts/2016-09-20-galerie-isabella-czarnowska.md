  For over twenty-five years, Galerie Isabella Czarnowska has played an
  important role in introducing exceptional contemporary artists to the Western
  European public. In the early days of the gallery, which was founded as
  Galerie Isabella Kacprzak in Stuttgart in 1986 and relocated to Cologne in
  1989, comprehensive monographic exhibitions featured American artists
  virtually unknown in Europe at the time: Allan McCollum, Louise Lawler and
  Richard Prince were among those presented here at an early stage in their
  careers.
