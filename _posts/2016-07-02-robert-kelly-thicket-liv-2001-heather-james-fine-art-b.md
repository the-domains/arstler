  Drawing on his extensive travels, Robert Kelly's painted collages contain
  found print and material from around the world. Kelly has included antique
  botanical drawings, handwritten notes, small sketches, vintage posters, and
  signs in his work. To create the ground for his paintings, he lays the
  re-appropriated paper in long strips to form irregular grids, small squares,
  and triangles.
