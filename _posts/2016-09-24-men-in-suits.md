  Men in Suits. The words can conjure up board meetings and business, or
  elegance and GQ, intrigue or luxury, an old-school uniform that is steadily
  falling out of favor. Focusing on implications of conformity and its
  expectations as presented by contemporary artists, this show looks at images
  that explore the meaning and attitudes behind the outfit - be it a three piece
  with tie or a superhero.
