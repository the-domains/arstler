  Ditching spray paint for tile and grout, Space Invader is known
  internationally for his pixelated aesthetic, with his figures gracing the
  facades of buildings in major cities across the globe. In 2000, Invader made
  his foray into the world of contemporary art-creating and exhibiting his
  pieces to sell in traditional brick and mortar galleries, often reproducing
  his street stencils into prints for consumption by the general public.
