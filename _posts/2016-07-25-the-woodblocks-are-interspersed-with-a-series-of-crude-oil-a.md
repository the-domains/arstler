  The Woodblocks are interspersed with a series of crude oil and petroleum jelly
  Body Prints (pictured). The transfer is achieved by Gormley falling directly
  onto the paper, the weight of his body leaving a corresponding print. The
  sacral use of crude oil as representative of the "blood of the earth"
  highlights our dependency on the planetâ€™s solar memory. Experienced in
  dialogue with each other, the tension between the immediacy of the Body Prints
  and the elusiveness of the multi-layered Woodblocks is made apparent. Whether
  through the indexical trace of wood or skin, both series of prints register,
  like a shadow, footprint or photograph, a lived moment in time.
