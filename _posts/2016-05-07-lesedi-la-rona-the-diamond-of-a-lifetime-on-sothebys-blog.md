  LONDON - When the largest rough diamond in more than a hundred years comes up
  for auction at Sotheby's London on 29 June, it will be the only lot on offer -
  and for good reason. First, at 1,109 carats and roughly the size of a tennis
  ball, this historic stone would make any other gem look diminutive.
