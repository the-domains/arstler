### Human traces in Landscapes

These images focus on how humans affect landscapes, from man made lakes, to roads and soccer fields carved in mountains. In each image, the eye can find traces of humanity that echoes Pablo Neruda's poem "Towards An Impure Poetry"

Marco Guerra lives and works in New York City.

His work is a result of a multi pollinated cultural identity.

His images are both abstract and figurative, as he addresses the narratives of distorted reality, traces, repetition and condensing of time.
