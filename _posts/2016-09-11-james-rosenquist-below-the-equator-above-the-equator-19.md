  Now | Artsy

description: >-
  Leading Pop artist James Rosenquist-who came to prominence among New York
  School figures like Roy Lichtenstein, Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, and
  Willem de Kooning-is well known for his large-scale, fragmented works that
  bring the visual language of commercial painting onto canvas (notably, from
  1957-60, Rosenquist earned his living as a billboard painter).
