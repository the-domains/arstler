  The old sensation is coming back. Blood pumping, heart pounding. Like swimming
  underwater and seeing the silhouette of a shark. In April Damien Hirst, who in
  recent years has seemed mostly occupied with curating his own art collection
  and building an award-winning gallery for it, will unveil a big exhibition of
  new works in two grand spaces in Venice called Treasures from the Wreck of the
  Unbelievable.
