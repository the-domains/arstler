  The philosophy of Existentialism was an influential undercurrent in art that
  aimed to explore the role of sensory perception, particularly vision, in the
  thought processes. Existentialism stressed the special character of personal,
  subjective experience and it insisted on the freedom and autonomy of the
  individual.
