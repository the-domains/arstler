# 'SEEING OURSELVES SENSING' by Eastwards Prospectus

by Eugen Berlo 2017-07-15

Tomorrow is the last day, but it's worth to make an appointment and pay a visit to the gallery. The group show is also a statement by Raluca Soaita and Andrei Breahna. As I like to follow up with a few galleries, I have (Yahveh) to say go and see it!; it is a good one and it will please you to see a nice range of artists, from Razvan Anton, Pavel Braila, Radu Cioca, to Tania Mouraud, Karolina Bregula and Mircea Stanescu. Many thanks to Răzvan Băbiceanu who walked me through.

> This public showing is the way Raluca Soaita and Andrei Breahna responsibly position themselves as related to the artists hosted by their gallery. The constant presence of video in the public space, the American-school photo, the drawing, the installation, the performance, the animation -- they all have shaped a certain artist / intellectual profile in the gallery space, one bearing various practices, which EASTWARDS PROSPECTUS is supporting and developing. The exhibition is a coherent and clear discourse about the gallerist/artist relationship, about the exhibition space and the challenges raised by certain works that one feels connected to.
