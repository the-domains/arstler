  Strictly speaking, Jungian archetypes refer to unclear underlying forms or the
  archetypes-as-such from which emerge images and motifs such as the mother, the
  child, the trickster, and the flood among others. It is history, culture and
  personal context that shape these manifest representations thereby giving them
  their specific content.
