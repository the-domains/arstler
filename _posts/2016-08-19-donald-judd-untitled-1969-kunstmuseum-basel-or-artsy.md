  Donald Judd, widely regarded as one of the most significant American artists
  of the post-war period, is perhaps best-known for the large-scale outdoor
  installations and long, spacious interiors he designed in Marfa, Texas. His
  oeuvre has come to define what has been referred to as Minimalist art-a label
  the artist strongly objected to.
