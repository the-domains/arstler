  Characterized by an extreme economy of means, the works that comprise
  Ellsworth Kelly's highly-regarded practice reveal the artist's keen interest
  in formal issues such as ground/foreground, planarity, shape, and line. This
  particular drawing is uniquely notable both as a brilliant juxtaposition of
  naturalistic plant drawing and hard edged abstraction, and also as the
  maquette for the cover of the original catalogue raisonné of Kelly's prints.
