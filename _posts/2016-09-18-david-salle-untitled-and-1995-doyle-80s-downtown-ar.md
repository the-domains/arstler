  Neo-expressionist painter David Salle gained prominence in the 1980s as a
  leader in the return to figuration, along with contemporaries Julian Schnabel,
  Francesco Clemente, Eric Fischl, and Jean-Michel Basquiat. He is well known
  for his large-scale canvases featuring a sparse, seemingly disjunctive
  arrangement of elements, often including provocatively posed women and nudes
  and the use of grisaille.
