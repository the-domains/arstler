  André Cadere was born in Poland, grew up in Romania and died in Paris in 1978.
  He was best known for his handmade series of painted round wooden bars,
  challenging the boundaries between painting and sculpture. Cadere was one of
  the first artists to realize that objects were inseparable from market and
  institutional contexts: half of his focus was on the systems of distribution
  in the art world, as he introduced bars in galleries and retract them, usually
  carrying a bar like a staff. His bars could be positioned in all sorts of
  relations to their surroundings (on walls, floors, propped between the two,
  etc.), but he would also carry them around a number of outdoor locations and
  into other people’s shows and openings, even when not invited, which made him
  quite ”infamous” at the time. (He was nicknamed ”The Stick Man”.)

# Andrei Cădere 

**André Cadere** was born in Poland, grew up in Romania and died in Paris in 1978\. He was best known for his handmade series of painted round wooden bars, challenging the boundaries between painting and sculpture. Cadere was one of the first artists to realize that objects were inseparable from market and institutional contexts: half of his focus was on the systems of distribution in the art world, as he introduced bars in galleries and retract them, usually carrying a bar like a staff. His bars could be positioned in all sorts of relations to their surroundings (on walls, floors, propped between the two, etc.), but he would also carry them around a number of outdoor locations and into other people's shows and openings, even when not invited, which made him quite "infamous" at the time. (He was nicknamed "The Stick Man".)

**Andrei Cădere **(1934-1978) este unul dintre cei mai importanţi reprezentanţi ai artei conceptuale mondiale. Ca fiu al unui proeminent diplomat român, Andrei Cădere a suferit în primele decenii comuniste o existență marginală, sub supravegherea Securității. A emigrat în Franța în 1967 și, după mai mulți ani de căutări, a devenit o figură memorabilă a scenei culturale pariziene și nu numai. Mereu însoțit de faimoasele lui toiege sculptate și pictate, descinzând inopinat în cele mai neșteptate locuri, Cădere s-a impus drept unul dintre cei mai originali artiști conceptuali și performativi din arta contemporană, fiind în prezent artistul român cu cea mai mare circulație, pe plan mondial, după Brâncuși.
