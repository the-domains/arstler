  Under-known Abstract Expressionist, Amaranth Ehrenhaltis still working,
  relying on color, line, and gesture to produce expressive works filled with
  dynamic, interactive, bold strokes. In these powerful works, words play an
  important part-the painting&rsquo;s titles often refer to memories. Ehrenhalt
  immerses herself in the process of creating on the canvas, using color to
  express both force and fragility.
