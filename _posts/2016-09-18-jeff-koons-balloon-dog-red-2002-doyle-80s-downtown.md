publisher: {}
description: >-
  Associated with the Neo-Geo movement of the 80's, Koons quickly went from a
  struggling artist working the MoMA membership desk to enfant terrible of the
  post-Pop art world. Embracing kitsch and banality and coupling it with a
  Warholian artist-as-brand, Koons solidified himself as both an art market
  force and a puckish prankster capable of confounding the public with his
  overly slick productions.
