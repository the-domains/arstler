  Berlin-based artist Volker Hüller puts a contemporary spin on modernist
  painting and etching, incorporating various mediums into his practice.
  Figurative yet surrealistic, Hüller's work combines geometric shapes with
  fragmented body parts, creating large-scale, Miró-esque pieces. His delicate,
  scratchy linework provides a striking contrast to collaged pieces of
  snakeskin, velvet, foil, and trash.
