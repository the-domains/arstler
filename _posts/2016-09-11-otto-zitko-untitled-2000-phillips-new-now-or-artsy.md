  Otto Zitko's drawings take on grandiose proportions, leaving the page behind
  for architecture. Zitko is known for his freewheeling oilstick drawings that
  cover entire exhibition spaces, though he works on smaller, contained surfaces
  as well. Zitko's work pushes the formal limits of line and examines the
  possibilities of drawing; his monumental scale endows drawings with
  phenomenological possibilities, placing them on the scale of architecture.
