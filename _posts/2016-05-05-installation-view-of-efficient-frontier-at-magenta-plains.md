Drawing its title from a financial management theory, this group show addresses the development of our corporate-driven society across two generations of artists—two were born in the 1950s, and the rest in the late ’70s to mid-’80s. These artists share a slippery approach to material. Straddling various media, they often combine video, performance, painting, photography, and sculpture to examine the ways in which culture and the corporate world intersect.'

Installation view of "Efficient Frontier" at Magenta Plains, 2016\. Photo courtesy of Magenta Plains. Drawing its title from a financial management theory, this group show addresses the development of our corporate-driven society across two generations of artists---two were born in the 1950s, and the rest in the late '70s to mid-'80s. These artists share a slippery approach to material. Straddling various media, they often combine video, performance, painting, photography, and sculpture to examine the ways in which culture and the corporate world intersect.
