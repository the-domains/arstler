  courtesy of Magenta Plains. Drawing its title from a financial management
  theory, this group show addresses the development of our corporate-driven
  society across two generations of artists—two were born in the 1950s, and the
  rest in the late ’70s to mid-’80s. These artists share a slippery approach to
  material. Straddling various media, they often combine video, performance,
  painting, photography, and sculpture to examine the ways in which culture and
  the corporate world intersect.
