  Architect and designer Christian Wassmann began his career at a young age in
  Switzerland. Interested in the intersection between the arts and architecture,
  his currently New York-based practice (housed in his Studio Christian
  Wassmann) focuses on the interconnections between art forms. The firm's
  ideology is guided by the design principle "form performs function," rather
  than the modernist mantra "form follows function."
