description: >-
  Muralist, painter, sculptor, and installation artist Kenny Scharf is best
  known for his fantastical, large-scale paintings of anthropomorphic animals
  and imagined creatures, as in Viva Mare Viva Mar (2011). Though Scharf's
  brightly colored imagery is generally playful, he has remarked that darker
  themes exist beneath the surface of his works, visible upon closer inspection.
