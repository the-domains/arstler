  Jon Pylypchuk, formerly a founding member of Manitoba's The Royal Art Lodge
  cooperative (1996-2008), is known for his sculptures of puppet-like creatures
  crafted from old clothes, stuffed toys, wood, and other refuse, sometimes
  given diorama-like installations that resemble miniature shantytowns. His
  mixed-media collages and works on paper display a similarly scavenged,
  folkloric aesthetic.
