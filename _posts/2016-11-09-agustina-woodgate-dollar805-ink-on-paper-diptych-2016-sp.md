  Agustina Woodgate creates art across multiple disciplines, her primary focus
  being the interplay between human beings and their surroundings. Born in
  Buenos Aires, Woodgate moved to Miami in 2004, where she gained recognition
  for covertly stitching labels inscribed with poems into thrift-store clothing
  ("poetry bombing,") and for her work made with human hair.
