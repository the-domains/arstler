# Antony Gormley: CAST

13 May 2016 - 30 Jul 2016

An exhibition of new prints by Antony Gormley, one of Britain's most widely acclaimed artists, will be unveiled from 13 May - 30 July 2016\. Marking his first project and exhibition with the Alan Cristea Gallery, Antony Gormley has made a series of works that consider how our physical freedom and imaginative potential is increasingly conditioned by the built environment.
