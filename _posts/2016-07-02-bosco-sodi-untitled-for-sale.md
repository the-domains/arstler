Bosco Sodi, Untitled for sale

Price does not include VAT, if applicable If you could immerse yourself in a color, it might look something like the works of Bosco Sodi (b. 1970). The Mexican artist creates his signature works of deep, lush hues using a combination of pure pigment, sawdust, wood pulp, natural fibers and glue.
